	@RESULTS
	{
		IkeInSpaceHigh = You ask Mission Control if they, too, like Ike.
		IkeInSpaceLow = You've changed your mind about Ike.
		IkeSrfLanded = You ask Mission Control what you're doing here.
		IkeSrfLanded = You see a green blur, and hope it isn't the kraken.
		IkeSrfLanded = Every moon has two sides, and you feel like you landed on the right one.
		IkeSrfLanded = Every moon has two sides, and you feel like you landed on the wrong one.
		IkeSrfLanded = You feel like there could be life on this tiny rock.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[evaReport]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		IkeInSpaceHigh = Gazing at Duna, you wonder whether life could... "BZZT, THIS IS MISSION CONTROL, SITUATION NOMINAL, OVER."
		IkeInSpaceLow = You get a strange sense of deja-vu.
		IkeSrfLanded = You consider going for a hike, but there's really nowhere to walk to here.
		IkeSrfLanded = It seems like a hike would be nice. What might you see from the other side of this moon? Pack plenty of air!
		IkeSrfLanded = While admiring the landscape, you notice that Jool is not moving. This could mean that Ike is tidally locked, or it could mean that you forgot your glasses.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mysteryGoo]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		IkeInSpaceLow = The Goo likes Ike, but is still a little creeped out by the weird terrain.
		IkeSrfLanded = The Goo rocks violently around the container. Is it throwing a tantrum?
		IkeSrfLanded = The Goo seems to like Ike.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[surfaceSample]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		IkeSrfLanded = You take several rock samples. They indicate a higher-than-average silica content.
		IkeSrfLanded = The soil is distributed in layers several millimetres thick and seems to be a product of tectonic activity.
		IkeSrfLanded = Soil samples you take suggest a moderate water content.
		IkeSrfLanded = You find a green mineral in the soil.
		IkeSrfLanded = The surface sample is one of the darkest colored things you have ever encountered in your life. You put it in the bottom of the sample container and try to forget how much it scared you.
		IkeSrfLanded = You collect some soil, which glimmers in all shades of grey.
		IkeSrfLanded = Your are about to take a sample, but get distracted by an asteroid flying overhead.
		IkeSrfLanded = You analyse a green mineral in the soil that looks like olivine.
		IkeSrfLanded = After a soil analysis you discover a moderate water content.
		IkeSrfLanded = It's a piece of Ike. You like Ike. Everyone likes Ike. You will bring it back to Kerbin!

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mobileMaterialsLab]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		IkeSrfLanded = The Science Rock looks like it's happy to be here. You make a note that it is a Science Rock and not a Pet Rock.
		IkeSrfLanded = The samples resonate with a patriotic frequency. You know, middle E... the note the theme song starts on? You start to hum to yourself.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[seismicScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		IkeSrfLanded = Even the seismic scan seems to like Ike.
		IkeSrfLanded = There is no sign of volcanic activity, but the surface is undergoing tidal stress from Jool's gravitational influence.
		IkeSrfLanded = Not much going on here.
		IkeSrfLanded = The quakes appear to be coming at regular intervals. A check of your star chart confirms they match the periapsis and apoapsis of the moon's orbit.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		IkeInSpaceHigh = The sensor verifies that Jool and Ike are tidally locked.
		IkeInSpaceLow = Gravity is very low!
		IkeSrfLanded = You detect fluctuations in Jool's tidal effect as it liberates in the distance.
		IkeSrfLanded = Gravity scanner reports a low reading, very similar to that of the Mun. Do all moons have the same gravity? R&D notes the theory down, but they use a pencil just in case.
