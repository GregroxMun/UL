@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[crewReport]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		PolInSpaceHigh = You wipe off the window to make sure that speck you see is not a piece of pollen.
		PolInSpaceLow = Turns out Pol is real, and not just a speck of pollen on the lens of Galileo Kerman's telescope. Who knew?
		PolInSpaceLow = Just looking at the surface makes you sneeze.
		PolSrfLanded = You are happy that landing is over.
		PolSrfLanded = You wonder if you can bring back some pol for your garden on Kerbin.
		PolSrfLanded = The crew has been reduced to excessive sneezing.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[evaReport]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		PolInSpaceHigh = You resist a sneeze.
		PolInSpaceLow = While outside the capsule, it is easier to see that Pol's surface is incredibly uneven. It also has an uncanny resemblance to a grain of pollen.
		PolSrfLanded = The rocks, the sand, and space itself seem to be filled with glitter. It gives you a headache.
		PolSrfLanded = Every edge looks dangerously sharp. You step carefully, trying not to shatter anything.
		PolSrfLanded = Looking at all the jagged rocks, you feel very thankful about not landing on them.
		PolSrfLanded = You worry that you'll never come back down if you jump.
		PolSrfLanded = This place might be very weird, but it's not as bad as it could be.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mysteryGoo]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		PolInSpaceHigh = The Goo twists itself into some sort of six-dimensional hyper-cube. You are glad that you became an astronaut instead of a scientist.
		PolInSpaceLow = The Mystery Goo resembles a grain of pollen almost identical to the Eelooan Moon.
		PolSrfLanded = The Goo seems to be allergic to its surroundings.
		PolSrfLanded = The Goo has assumed a flower shape.
		PolSrfLanded = You wonder if the Goo has more poles than it did before.
		PolSrfLanded = The Goo starts buzzing like a bumblebee.
		PolSrfLanded = The Goo sneezes. Gesundheit.

}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[surfaceSample]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		PolSrfLanded = You feel slight irritation as you shove a handful of colorful sand into the storage container.
		PolSrfLanded = As you pick up the sample, your eyes start to water. Thinking it would not be good to sneeze in your suit, you put the chunk of surface back down.
		PolSrfLanded = The rock sample you take crumbles into dust in your hand. You put it into your bag.
		PolSrfLanded = After analyzing some samples, you found phosphoric and sulfuric compounds in the ground. If you bring this back to Kerbin, we can make some matches.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mobileMaterialsLab]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		PolSrfLanded = Small pieces of Pol cover the samples.
		PolSrfLanded = Some of the samples have shrivelled up.
		PolSrfLanded = You hear a sneeze in the bay.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[temperatureScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		PolInSpaceLow = The thermometer wants to come inside because it's cold.
		PolInSpaceLow = The temperature varies as you fly over the terrain.
		PolSrfLanded = The temperature varies from one rock formation to another. They must each conduct heat differently.
		PolSrfLanded = Scientists have confirmed that there is no temperature present on Pol.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[seismicScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		PolSrfLanded = There seems to be a lot of seismic activity around Pol's surface.
		PolSrfLanded = The sensor registers very weak vibrations, which could provide a clue as to why Pol is shaped so strangely.
		PolSrfLanded = These results are gibberish! The interior of this little moon must be messier than Bob's office.
		PolSrfLanded = After squinting at the device, you can still see vibrations from your landing on the screen, circling the (very tiny) globe.
		PolSrfLanded = Apart from the occasional Kerbal falling down the cliff, there isn't much for the seismometer to detect.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		PolSrfLanded = There are roughly twice as many left-handed negative graviolis as right-handed ones here. That means something. Nobody knows what, though.
	}
