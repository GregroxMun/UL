		EelooInSpaceHigh = You look out the window and notice beige areas and spots on the surface. You immediately wonder if it's cookie dough.
		EelooInSpaceHigh = It reminds you of a snowball. Is it winter already?
		EelooInSpaceHigh = It looks like a great big spherical ice cube!
		EelooInSpaceHigh = Now this is an icy planet. You start imagining epic snowball fights in micro-gravity.
		EelooInSpaceHigh = Eeloo looks very white; maybe someone covered it in a giant bed sheet?
		EelooInSpaceHigh = As you stare down at the splintered, lifeless surface, a question forms in your mind: "Was this really worth it?"
		EelooInSpaceLow = You note that the capsule is not equipped with central heating, and Mission Control informs you this is because you were meant to go to Moho. This does not instill you with confidence.
		EelooInSpaceLow = For a moment, you can't quite remember which star is your sun.
		EelooInSpaceLow = I feel like we could go anywhere. Let's go. Like, now. Really, anywhere.
		EelooInSpaceLow = The crew look out towards the frozen ice ball Eeloo, and are momentarily lost for words. Few of Kerbal-kind have made it this far from home, and the courage, determination, and drive their species has to put them here dawns on everyone. Their thoughts are profound and humble, that so few are supported by so many.
		EelooInSpaceLow = Eeloo's cratered surface reminds you of Kerbin's moons. After some thinking about your distance from home, you go to sleep.
		EelooInSpaceLow = You're beginning to regret not bringing along the extra bag of snacks.
		EelooSrfLanded = You look out the windows and see ice. Lots and lots of ice. And some rocks here and there. Icy rocks.
		EelooSrfLanded = You wonder what's beneath the ice...
		EelooSrfLanded = You report that Eeloo is "distant and lonely". Mission Control is not happy and demands more information.
		EelooSrfLanded = It seems you have eaten all of your snacks. You start weeping quietly in the corner.
		EelooSrfLanded = You take notes on how barren and lonely Eeloo is. You then try to calculate how long it will take for the signal to get to and from Kerbin.
		EelooSrfLanded = From this far away, the radio seems to be a bit patchy. You can hear static blocking out your next instructions. Oh well, it probably wasn't important anyway.
		EelooSrfLanded = You wonder about the ship that got you here. Are you really sure you can get back?
		EelooSrfLanded = As you trip and fall on a very small rock, you begin to lose feeling in your arms. Terrified of the sub zero temperatures, you look down and realize you've been laying on them.
		EelooSrfLanded = You feel cold.
		EelooSrfLanded = You feel very cold.
		EelooSrfLanded = You feel very hot. The physician diagnoses you with extreme hypothermia. Then you realize you hallucinated the physician.
		EelooSrfLanded = You look out of the capsule and can't find Kerbin. What has mission control gotten you into this time?

		EelooSrfLanded = You lie down and make a snow Kerbal.
		EelooSrfLanded = Even though the suit is well insulated, you can feel the cold seeping into your feet.
		EelooSrfLanded = You pat the ground. Hopefully you cheered up the planet a little.
		EelooSrfLanded = You step off the capsule to the crackling of ice under your boots. Your eyes adjust to the faint light. From way out here, Kerbol is just another star. You reflect upon the several year journey it took to get here.
		EelooSrfLanded = You get the feeling you left your oven on back home.
		EelooSrfLanded = As you think about the distance and time it took to get you here, a sudden shiver runs down your spine.
		EelooSrfLanded = You feel like Eeloo has been alone for a long time. You contemplate staying a little while longer.
		EelooSrfLanded = It is very cold. You realize that you probably should have brought a sweater.
		EelooSrfLanded = You want to build a snow-Kerbal. Sadly, Eeloo is made of ice, not snow.

		EelooSrfLanded = You suddenly realize that there's no way you'll be able to walk home from here.
		EelooSrfLanded = You look at the Sun, and feel very, very lonely...

		EelooSrfLanded = The Goo quivers, rattling the container shut several times.
		EelooSrfLanded = The Goo turns white. It seems to feel at home here.
		EelooSrfLanded = The Goo has taken the form of its container. It's not very good at it, however.
		EelooSrfLanded = The sides of the container, for the first time, are clean! The Goo has gathered at the bottom, and looks very dusty.
		EelooSrfLanded = The Goo is mysterious as ever.
		EelooSrfLanded = As the fine ice crystals kicked up by your landing on the surface slowly gather on the the top of the container, you gingerly tap at the Goo with your finger, expecting it to shatter at any moment.
		EelooSrfLanded = The Goo has become many small grains, ideal for an Eeloo sundae.
		EelooSrfLanded = The Goo appears to have shattered into many tiny frozen fragments upon touchdown.
		EelooSrfLanded = The Goo walks out of the container, picks up a sample, and walks back in.

		EelooSrfLanded = This looks like the icing I had on my birthday cake!
		EelooSrfLanded = Frozen nitrogen. You might have to keep this stuff in the fridge for the return trip.
		EelooSrfLanded = This is just ice and dirt. You question why you couldn't have gotten this from the North Pole.
		EelooSrfLanded = The material seems very icy and brittle. You try not to think of how you landed here.
		EelooSrfLanded = You take a scoop of the surface, eager to drizzle chocolate sauce on it later.
		EelooSrfLanded = You take a surface sample and put it in your soft drink.
		EelooSrfLanded = You take a surface sample and crumple it into a snowball.
		EelooSrfLanded = The surface is so hard that you have to use a pickaxe to get a sample.
		EelooSrfLanded = You decide that when you get back to the ship, you will check the sample for vanilla flavoring.
		EelooSrfLanded = The ground appears to be made up of many frozen things, including rocks, dirt, frost, water, and various metal ores.
		EelooSrfLanded = You pick up a handful of extremely fine-grained icy material. It sublimates from the warmth of your spacesuit glove, drifting away as a short-lived wisp of vapors before refreezing and falling back to the surface.
		EelooSrfLanded = It looks... icy. You wonder what you are doing here in the first place.
		EelooSrfLanded = You immediately find out that layers of microscopic ice crystals orbit this body. Launched them out here by the past impacts.

	@RESULTS
	{
		EelooInSpaceHigh = The samples have stopped moving. You aren't sure if this is because of the cold or the time it took to get here.
		EelooInSpaceLow = You used the science lab to assemble a miniature model of the science lab. There was a lot of downtime while waiting to get to Eeloo.
		EelooSrfLanded = Most of the materials are frozen solid.
		EelooSrfLanded = All of the materials have frozen solid, except for one which has mysteriously caught fire.
		EelooSrfLanded = A strange green crystal has grown. Maybe Mission Control will know what to do with it.
		EelooSrfLanded = You illuminate one of the samples, and it follows the light. You play with it for a little while.
		EelooSrfLanded = A liquid canister spills onto the ground and flash freezes in place. Not very informative, but very pretty.
		EelooSrfLanded = One of the samples goes mad and jumps out of the materials bay. He was always the weird one anyway.

		EelooSrfLanded = The ground temperature is higher than the surrounding space only by a fraction of a degree.
		EelooSrfLanded = You watch the mercury in the thermometer break through the bottom and freeze.
		EelooSrfLanded = The display reads "really cold". You make a note to get a less sassy thermometer.
		EelooSrfLanded = The temperature is surprisingly hot. Perhaps there's some volcanic activity... never mind, someone put the thermometer on upside down.

		EelooSrfLanded = What's colder than being cold? ICE COLD!
		EelooSrfLanded = The thermometer picks up trace amounts of temperature.
		EelooSrfLanded = The thermometer seems to be shivering. You give it a scarf and a mug of cocoa.
		EelooSrfLanded = The mercury seems to have retreated into the bulb at the bottom. You peck at the bulb several times, hoping for it to reemerge. Is it really that cold?
		EelooSrfLanded = This far from the Sun, Eeloo's surface is barely affected by its radiation.

	@RESULTS
	{
		EelooInSpaceHigh = Before you left Kerbin, the program director told you of the great gravity of your mission. It is clear to you now that he exaggerated.
		EelooInSpaceLow = The gravity of Eeloo is relatively small, which in turn gives it a small SoI. You are happy that the guys back on Kerbin are actually skilled enough to hit an object of this size from so far away.
		EelooSrfLanded = This planetoid has a small but significant gravitational force, perfect for extreme snowball fights.
