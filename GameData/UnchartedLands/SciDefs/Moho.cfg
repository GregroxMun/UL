		MohoSrfLanded = Rocks all look the same to you. Wishing you had taken that geology course back on Kerbin, you try to break some stones by hitting them hard against each other. They seem to be very sturdy and don't break at all.
		MohoSrfLanded = Rocks lying around seem to be ejecta from volcanic eruptions.
		MohoSrfLanded = The sample is very brittle and is covered with micro-cracks. It suggests that a super-heated atmosphere may have once existed here.
