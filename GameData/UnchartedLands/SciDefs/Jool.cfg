		JoolInSpaceLow = You note just how big Jool is, and try not to think about how small it makes you feel.
		JoolInSpaceLow = The massive size of the Van Allen radiation belts is ripping electrons from the ship's hull. You carefully avoid the walls, avoiding being zapped with the mother of all static discharges.
		JoolInSpaceLow = Maybe you'd be able to get a sample of metallic hydrogen before the inevitable crunch?
		JoolInSpaceLow = The giant orb is looking even bigger now.
		JoolFlyingHigh = While observing from the window you get startled as Jool seems to look back at you! After a moment of confusion you find out that it was your face reflecting from the window and comment on the screams to have been "only radio chatter".
		JoolFlyingHigh = As the craft flies through the dense clouds, it slows down dramatically. Just don't get stuck.
		JoolFlyingHigh = It's more than disconcerting to see clouds in all directions.

		JoolFlyingLow = As you look up through the stormy clouds, it strikes you that maybe flying that low in Jool's atmosphere wasn't such a good idea.
		JoolFlyingLow = The craft is shaking and feels very unstable.
		JoolFlyingLow = You realize you are not a probe.
		JoolFlyingLow = Your aerobraking attempt has turned into an aero landing. Was this part of the plan?

		JoolFlyingLow = You may have gotten yourself into a bit of a pickle.
		JoolFlyingLow = Landing on Jool, eh? Why not?
		JoolFlyingLow = Still no sign of a surface. Perhaps if you flew even lower?

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[evaReport]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{

		JoolInSpaceLow = You look around and think you just saw Kerbin.
		JoolFlyingHigh = You feel your skin burn as you leave the vessel. It would be a good idea to get back on board!
		JoolFlyingHigh = You find that the outside pressures are equal with your suit's interior pressure. Removing your helmet would still be a rather poor idea.
		JoolFlyingHigh = Feeling insignificant near the towering mass of the gas giant, you are inclined to think that size matters after all.
		JoolFlyingHigh = You want to get back in as soon as possible.
		JoolFlyingLow = I think I just heard something crack in my helmet. Can I go home?
		JoolFlyingLow = You are advised to get back into the capsule, fast.
		JoolFlyingLow = You feel a sudden urge to see what would happen if you landed on a gas giant.
		JoolFlyingLow = HOW DID I LET YOU GUYS TALK ME INTO THIS!?
		JoolFlyingLow = You realize that diving into a gas giant never sounded like a good idea.
		JoolFlyingLow = Kerbin, I think we have a problem. I do, anyways...
		JoolFlyingLow = As you wing-walk amongst the green clouds, you suddenly wonder how you will get home now.
		JoolFlyingLow = Your life flashes before your eyes. You realize it's best you leave Jool as soon as possible.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mysteryGoo]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		JoolInSpaceHigh = The Goo seems to be moving more slowly here, almost as if it needed the warmth of the Sun.
		JoolInSpaceHigh = The Goo tries to inflate and appears larger than the planet. It clearly has no sense of scale.
		JoolInSpaceLow = The Goo seems to be at peace with itself.
		JoolInSpaceLow = You feel malicious intent emanating from the Goo.
		JoolFlyingHigh = The Goo begins to bubble.
		JoolFlyingHigh = The way the Goo jiggles under Joolian winds reminds you of how your cheeks jiggle during launch.
		JoolFlyingHigh = The Goo appears to be taking down observations about you.
		JoolFlyingLow = The Goo looks VERY concerned.
		JoolFlyingLow = The Goo has taken on a orange hue as it flubs about the container.
		JoolFlyingLow = The Goo does not appear content with the current situation.

	@RESULTS
	{
		JoolInSpaceHigh = We came, we saw, we did science. And we're still here.
		JoolInSpaceHigh = We came, we saw, we did science. And we're still here.
		JoolFlyingHigh = Jool's immense gravity is pulling the materials towards one side of the container.
		JoolFlyingLow = The samples are running around in circles.
		JoolFlyingLow = One of the samples is panicking.
		JoolFlyingLow = The pressure of the Jool's atmosphere is so high that a few of the samples have begun fusing together.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[temperatureScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		JoolInSpaceLow = The thermometer says the temperature is 7000, but refuses to say what units it is using.
		JoolFlyingHigh = Temperatures are quite high.
		JoolFlyingHigh = Readings appear to be too cool for Jool.
		JoolFlyingHigh = Jool seems to be rich in very dense temperature particles.
		JoolFlyingLow = Warmer gas from deep within Jool brings the surrounding temperatures up.
		JoolFlyingLow = Temperatures appear to be quite nominal.
		JoolFlyingLow = Atmospheric pressure seems to be heating the interior of Jool.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[barometerScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		JoolFlyingHigh = Cracks start to appear as you enter deeper into the atmosphere.
		JoolFlyingHigh = The pressures start rising in comparison to the surrounding area. You take this as a good sign - Joolian storms are nothing to sneeze at.
		JoolFlyingHigh = A massive blast of wind shakes the spacecraft. Of course, you didn't exactly need a barometer to tell you this.
		JoolFlyingHigh = The atmosphere here is very dense. The glass components appear to be weakening. Let's blame the engineers if anything breaks!
		JoolFlyingLow = You notice the barometer has a crack in it shaped like a doughnut. There's also a reading about the pressure, but you've stopped caring.
		JoolFlyingLow = The barometer's hand switched from "You sure we're in an atmosphere and not underwater?" to "Look, I wasn't built to record pressures in kbar". It suddenly dawns on you that you might have aerobraked a bit too deep.
		JoolFlyingLow = The sensor starts breaking under pressure.
		JoolFlyingLow = The immense pressure causes the sensor to implode.
		JoolFlyingLow = Pressure increases quite rapidly, then stabilizes on "-65535". It occurs to you that the barometer may be broken.
		JoolFlyingLow = The barometer reads lower than expected. Perhaps you are in the eye of a storm?
		JoolFlyingLow = The barometer lets out some steam and fails to give a proper reading of the immensely thick atmosphere.
		JoolFlyingLow = The scanner only has time to say "I hate you!" before the voice module implodes.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{

		JoolInSpaceHigh = The science team is going to get to write that "Large things in space produce large numbers" paper after all.
		JoolInSpaceHigh = Yup. It's big.
		JoolInSpaceLow = The readings fluctuate tremendously as the moons pass by.
		JoolInSpaceLow = The sensor is painfully giving readouts while trying to keep itself in one piece.
		JoolInSpaceLow = Jool's massive gravity well causes time to slow from your perspective.
		JoolInSpaceLow = You secure the sensor with a few more bolts just in case. It trembles in fear, but you give it a reassuring pat.

		JoolFlyingLow = "Do you smell that? That smelly smell... it smells... smelly..."
		JoolFlyingLow = The atmosphere seems to be very thick here.
		JoolFlyingLow = The atmosphere is getting much denser now. However, it appears to be unusually transparent.
		JoolFlyingLow = Don't be silly.
		JoolFlyingLow = The chemical content is extremely strange here, possibly explaining how the planet got its distinctive colors.
