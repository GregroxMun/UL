	@RESULTS
	{
		BopInSpaceHigh = Bop looks remarkably like a potato from this height. 
		BopInSpaceHigh = Mission Control informs you that that no, that is not a potato outside your window.
		BopInSpaceHigh = You realize that that mountain is remarkably high.
		BopInSpaceHigh = This rock looks completely unremarkable. You have an uneasy feeling about it, most probably because youâ€™ve been out of tasty snacks for the last six months.
		BopInSpaceHigh = The captured asteroid looks like a big brown potato. You can't help but wonder if changing inclination was worth the trouble.
		BopInSpaceLow = That mountain high enough to hit you. You hope you are landing.
		BopInSpaceLow = You wonder if Twist and Pull are around here somewhere?
		BopInSpaceLow = You stare out of the window, only to see some rough, jagged terrain that fails to please the eye.
		BopInSpaceLow = Bop looks unremarkable. TOO unremarkable. Surely it's hiding some dark secret...
		BopSrfLanded = You smell squid. The pilot must be eating sushi. What else could it be?
		BopSrfLanded = From here Bop looks entirely untrustworthy.
		BopSrfLanded = You hear an odd noise on the radio, most probably caused by radiation from the host planet.
		BopSrfLanded = You're not sure why, but this place gives you an eerie feeling.
		BopSrfLanded = I could probably see Kerbin from here! If only I had a telescope...
		BopSrfLanded = Mission Control tells you that the amazing vista you see is just an optical illusion. You take some picture anyway.
		BopSrfLanded = The landing legs sink into the surface and make a squelching sound.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[evaReport]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		BopInSpaceHigh = The moon strikingly resembles a potato.
		BopInSpaceHigh = Mission Control tells you that Bop is that little brown thing. You had gone on EVA to move it away from the ship.
		BopInSpaceLow = I wish that we were not here.
		BopInSpaceLow = I can see the ship from up here!
		BopSrfLanded = You feel uneasy. This place is dark and inhospitable.
		BopSrfLanded = You feel that something is wrong. Even more so than when you were in your spacecraft. You feel like there's something behind you, but when you turn around, nothing is there.
		BopSrfLanded = You look around at the tops of the round lumps around you and think you see a small flash in the distance. You put down "weird" in the mission report.
		BopSrfLanded = The air feels murky and ominous. A second later, you remember there is no air on Bop, so it's probably just your suit being out of order.
		BopSrfLanded = You note that it seems boring here, and wish you'd been allowed to bring the beach ball you wanted to.
		BopSrfLanded = There's something ominous lurking here... you just know it.
		BopSrfLanded = The low gravity is counterbalanced by a strong attraction to Jool. It is very green.
		BopSrfLanded = Mission Control tells you not to take off your helmet.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mysteryGoo]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		BopInSpaceHigh = The Goo seems to try to get your attention.
		BopInSpaceHigh = The Goo bops you playfully on the head.
		BopInSpaceLow = The Goo has assumed a greenish shape with multiple extrusions.
		BopInSpaceLow = The Goo feels very uncomfortable.
		BopInSpaceLow = The Goo seems agitated and attempts to escape its container.
		BopSrfLanded = The Goo isn't doing well.
		BopSrfLanded = The Goo turns into an odd, green-colored ball.
		BopSrfLanded = You ponder what the Goo is. Only here have you ever thought this.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[surfaceSample]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		BopSrfLanded = The rocks lying around look very dull. You shove one into your sample container, just to pass time.
		BopSrfLanded = You pick up a rock from the ground. It looks somewhat unusual so you put it into the container.
		BopSrfLanded = The soil here is surprisingly soft, like play-koh.
		BopSrfLanded = As you take a sample, it begins to glow... and starts shaking. It clearly does not like being contained.
		BopSrfLanded = Just under the surface you find a black, glassy material and put it in the sample bag. A volcanic residue perhaps?
		BopSrfLanded = Just under the surface you analyse a black, glassy material. A volcanic mineral called obsidian.
		BopSrfLanded = You analyse a red-brown mineral. It appears to be hard and very moist, like rusty iron.
		BopSrfLanded = You pick up an orange mineral. It appears to be soft and very moist.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mobileMaterialsLab]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		BopInSpaceLow = You open the doors and notice something small and green. The scientists said they lost a radioactive squid the other day. You hope this won't affect your journey home.
		BopSrfLanded = You think you see a small tentacle, but the video flickers, and it's gone.
		BopSrfLanded = The materials are getting a little freaked out, which in turn freaks you out. Bop is truly an evil place.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[temperatureScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		BopSrfLanded = Bop's temperature seems highly suspect...
		BopSrfLanded = The thermometer reads 666 degrees kelvin. That... that can't be right.
		BopSrfLanded = Bop is trying to mislead your temperature readings. Or maybe it's not Bop, but something that lives on Bop?
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[seismicScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		BopSrfLanded = Among all the shakes and jitters, you notice a continual pulsing pattern. It makes you feel uneasy.
		BopSrfLanded = How can it be that Bop is this rock-steady for such a small moon?
		BopSrfLanded = The planet gives off steady quakes which grow in intensity as Vall passes; as it leaves, they settle down again. This would be expected if the other moons did the same.
		BopSrfLanded = There are subtle vibrations that cannot be explained by Bop's physical characteristics.
		BopSrfLanded = The small moon is resonating with an odd musical frequency. Hooking the sensor feed up to some speakers, you recognize it as a toccata.
		BopSrfLanded = The seismometer briefly goes off the charts, then seems to decide that Bop is geologically dead.
		BopSrfLanded = Some vibrations have been detected under your vessel. You start to think about the creepy stories your friends have told you.
		BopSrfLanded = Bop seems to be impacted often... what is hitting it?
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		BopInSpaceHigh = The scanner is still pointing at Jool.
		BopInSpaceHigh = What does this "%NaN%" mean? Mission Control tells you to watch out for Krakens.
		BopInSpaceHigh = The gravity levels are fluctuating slightly. Not enough to cause any obvious problems, but enough to indicate that there is more to Bop than we currently understand.
		BopInSpaceLow = The peaks seem rather close. The gravity scanner agrees.
		BopInSpaceLow = Scanning returns a result of "0".
		BopSrfLanded = The scanner seems split between Jool and Bop. You put it down to a defect.
		BopSrfLanded = The scanner refuses to point at Bop. After frantic calls to the manufacturer, Mission Control tells you that it is rated to high.
		BopSrfLanded = There seems to be a spike over one location... wait, it's gone now.
