		KerbinFlyingHigh = You are almost in an orbit with your home planet.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You float through the air, eating the levitating chips.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Alarmingly, one side of the ship feels really hot. The other side doesn't, though, so it should be fine.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You stare out the window in deep thought, pondering the answer to the ultimate question, before being rudely interrupted by the Mission Control.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You marvel at the weightless nuts and bolts as they dance around the cabin. You briefly wonder what parts of your craft they had once held in place.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You're in space and not dead. The crew and Mission Control have agreed that it's indeed a big step forward.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Much to your chagrin, Scott Kerman gets on the radio and begins educating the crew about proper bathroom procedures. Again.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You attempt to perform a juggling act, only to have the balls fly off in various directions due to micro-gravity. You hope they didn't hit any important buttons this time.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = LOOK! Another star! And hey... there's another! Wow, space is awesome.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = After rigorous testing, the crew has determined that micro-gravity increases the fun of bouncy balls by 200%.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = "This is why we need fancy suits, huh?"
		KerbinInSpaceLow = They didn't fly into space, storm a beach or bring back gold! No, sir, we did! It's you and me against the world, son!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = This is Major Kerman to Mission Control, I'm feeling very still. And I think my spaceship knows which way to go.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = It's time to leave the capsule... right?

		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You swear you saw a blue police box flashing away on a retrograde orbit.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Let's engage Warp Drive... wait, we don't have Warp Drive?
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Everything looks so small from up here.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You really want to get out and take a walk, but there's nothing to walk on.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You make an observation, but the lack of gravity stops your pen from working. Perhaps you should have brought a pencil.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The surface of Kerbin is the shore of the cosmic ocean. Recently you've waded a little way out, maybe ankle-deep, and the water seems inviting.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = "Crew reporting in. Everything is nominal here."
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The planet appears to be round! It's not flat like we thought!

		KerbinInSpaceLow = It's so big. You wonder if you can see your house from here. Probably not.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = "If you're hearing this, it means you're taking a long time on this spacewalk. The lab boys say that might be a fear reaction."
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The lone Kerbal loves it out here.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = It crosses your mind that a thin layer of Mylar and glass is the only thing separating you from nothing.
