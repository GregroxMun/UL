	@RESULTS
	{
		DunaInSpaceHigh = You stare at the planet far beneath you, trying to work out which place would be the most suitable to narrowly avoid exploding on.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = The crew is concerned that the planet is "too orange". Mission Control does not believe this is a good reason to go home.
		DunaInSpaceLow = Can it be Kerbiformed?
		DunaFlyingHigh = There seems to be something resembling a face on the surface of a planet, but it's only a play of light and shadow.
		DunaFlyingLow = You gaze at the planet, and realize you'll have no problems keeping your night vision.
		DunaFlyingLow = You notice you are coming in close to the large moon, and you secretly hope to find intelligent life!
		DunaFlyingLow = You think you see a face. Maybe it was a trick of the light... No, no... that's a face.
		DunaFlyingLow = You really like Duna. It reminds you of chocolate pancakes somehow.
		DunaFlyingLow = You shiver in your seat. Your thoughts turn to the glowing warmth of re-entry into Kerbin's atmosphere and you start to miss your family.
		DunaSrfLanded = You look out, and note the massive geological features. This moon is being slowly torn apart by it's ominous parent.
		DunaSrfLanded = Very small piles of fine grain dust are being deposited on the windows by the thin atmosphere.
		DunaSrfLanded = "It's extremely orange; over."
		DunaSrfLanded = It is quite dusty outside.
		DunaSrfLanded = Duna's surface seems to be covered with mountains instead of dunes as you'd hoped. You remark that the planet was named poorly.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[evaReport]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		DunaFlyingHigh = Luckily the Duna atmosphere is thin. Otherwise you and your craft would get separated very quickly pulling a stunt like this.
		DunaFlyingLow = The curving edge of the planet shows just a hint of red surrounding a sea of orange ground below you. It's beautiful!
		DunaSrfLanded = It feels as though a stiff breeze is tugging at your ankles. You suspect that gas is escaping from your spacesuit, and makes you slightly nervous.
		DunaSrfLanded = I'm hungry. Where is my pizza?
		DunaSrfLanded = You feel like a true hero as you march across the red planet, until you realize you're a long, long way from home.
		DunaSrfLanded = Would this be a good place to have giant sand worms for pets?
		DunaSrfLanded = Duna's low gravity would lend itself well to an exciting game of basketball! You consider adding a hoop to your next lander design.
		DunaSrfLanded = You see orange. A LOT of orange.
		DunaSrfLanded = The air is a little thin up here. Down here? Who knows!
		DunaSrfLanded = A gust of wind creates a small dust storm, it's hard to see.
		DunaSrfLanded = You've proven the alien conspiracy theorists wrong. There are no tall, pink men anywhere to be seen.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mysteryGoo]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		DunaInSpaceHigh = The Goo is forming into geometric shapes! Sphere, pyramid, cube, diamond... Is that a face? It's your face!
		DunaInSpaceLow = The Goo has split into lots of little Goos. They appear to be voting on a leader.
		DunaInSpaceLow = The Goo likes it here. It's like a second home for The Goo!
		DunaFlyingHigh = The Goo looks longingly homeward. At least, you think that's what it's doing.
		DunaFlyingLow = The colors excites The Goo.
		DunaSrfLanded = The Goo looks pink.
		DunaSrfLanded = The Goo slowly rotates, catching what little dust is in the air this far north.
		DunaSrfLanded = The Goo staunchly avoids one side of the container.
		DunaSrfLanded = The Goo seems to have spattered about the container during the landing.
		DunaSrfLanded = The Goo seems to be very proud.
		DunaSrfLanded = Here the Goo is turning red and angry.
		DunaSrfLanded = The Goo has gotten dust all over itself.
		DunaSrfLanded = The Goo rocks side to side, as though on a boat.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[surfaceSample]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		DunaSrfLanded = The soil here is like boring, dirt mixed with ice crystals, with a thin layer of frost on top.
		DunaSrfLanded = Breaking through the thin crust, you find layers of dirt mixed with ice, laid down in countless cycles of thawing and freezing.
		DunaSrfLanded = The exact chemical composition of the surface will no doubt be of interest to the scientists back home.
		DunaSrfLanded = You take a surface sample, hoping to determine if water was once flowing here.
		DunaSrfLanded = Layers of darker sediment have been deposited here by long-dead streams and the constant wind.
		DunaSrfLanded = The floor of this depression seems to be composed of sedimentary rocks.
		DunaSrfLanded = You pick up some loose stones that look to have been part of a landslide.
		DunaSrfLanded = You chip away at the hard basalt with your rock hammer and eventually get a good sample.
		DunaSrfLanded = Different colored rocks are probably made of different stuff. You should grab as many as you can.
		DunaSrfLanded = It appears this soil could be used for snack production, possibly after several centuries of Kerbal-forming.
		DunaSrfLanded = This dust could be some unusual oxide, or possibly cinnamon. You debate with Mission control over which is more likely.
		DunaSrfLanded = You wonder if you need to take a sample considering there is so much dust on you that you could be considered a sample on your own right.
		DunaSrfLanded = Nope. Not barbecue flavored.
		DunaSrfLanded = Yup. Dust. Are you surprised?
		DunaSrfLanded = It's very thin and fine. You imagine a rover could easily become stuck in this if it had small wheels.
		DunaSrfLanded = This dust works well for drawing pictures on your space suit.
		DunaSrfLanded = Unable to satisfy your curiosity, you attempt to drill into the rock. It would be much easier if you had a machine to help.
		DunaSrfLanded = You make a note: "Bring laser next time."
		DunaSrfLanded = You find a nice metal ruler in the sand! You're ready to proclaim the discovery of an alien civilization, but then you find that the one in your ship is missing.
		DunaSrfLanded = You pick up a rock sample. It looks a bit like limestone. You consider it important and put it into your sample container.
		DunaSrfLanded = It looks like some sort of spice.
		DunaSrfLanded = There appears to be traces of water in the soil!
		DunaSrfLanded = The ground here appears to be mostly basalt from ancient lava flows, with a thin coating of sand and dust.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mobileMaterialsLab]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		DunaSrfLanded = The samples appear to be permanently orange. You wonder why Mission Control didn't send you here in the orange EVA suits to reduce cleaning costs.
		DunaSrfLanded = Observing becomes somewhat difficult as dust cakes over the camera lens.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[temperatureScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		DunaInSpaceLow = The surface below glints curiously and is covered in large ridges.
		DunaFlyingHigh = Turning up the thermostat in your climate controlled suit does little to keep the cold from creeping into your toes.
		DunaFlyingHigh = The temperature rise from the planet's radiation isn't as much as expected. Especially seeing it's proximity to it's parent!
		DunaFlyingLow = You wish you could drink a cup of hot chocolate, but you can't take your helmet off. The thermometer seems to be frozen solid.
		DunaFlyingLow = Duna ain't the kind of place to raise a kid. Matter of fact, it's cold as heck. And there's nobody there to raise them, if you did.
		DunaSrfLanded = The air is cold. The atmosphere must not support a strong greenhouse effect.
		DunaSrfLanded = Duna is awfully cold for being so bright.
		DunaSrfLanded = Duna is colder than you expected.
		DunaSrfLanded = The thin air is colder than anything you'd find on Kerbin.
		DunaSrfLanded = Duna ain't the kind of place to raise your kids; in fact, it's cold as heck.
		DunaSrfLanded = You wouldn't know it by looking, but its actually really cold out here.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[barometerScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		DunaFlyingLow = This measurement will provide more information about the composition and pressure gradient of Duna's atmosphere.
		DunaFlyingLow = Even the barometer isn't sure how to interpret the readings.
		DunaSrfLanded = Evaporating ice from the surface must raise the pressure by a tiny fraction.
		DunaSrfLanded = The atmosphere appears slightly denser here.
		DunaSrfLanded = Ice subliming off the surface raises the pressure very slightly.
		DunaSrfLanded = There's air here, but not much of it.
		DunaSrfLanded = The pressure in this basin is a whole notch higher on the scale.
		DunaSrfLanded = The pressure here is the highest you've recorded, but it's still as low as in the upper atmosphere back home.
		DunaSrfLanded = The air here is so thin, you feel like you could reach up and touch space.
		DunaSrfLanded = Pressure reads: "Gasping for air". You add an addendum about more numbers and less wisecracking.
		DunaSrfLanded = This data will help to determine the pressure gradient of Duna's atmosphere.
		DunaSrfLanded = The atmosphere seems to be quite thin here, but it's still preferable to the hard vacuum of space.
		DunaSrfLanded = There isn't much atmosphere here. You consider lighting candles to create more.
		DunaSrfLanded = There's barely enough air here to fill a parachute, and don't even think of trying to breathe it.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[seismicScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		DunaSrfLanded = The seismic scan picks up some vibrations as gas vents from below the surface.
		DunaSrfLanded = The scan detects some activity, probably associated with tidal forces from Jool.
		DunaSrfLanded = Your scan records a few small tremors. Hopefully there are no Duna dinosaurs.
		DunaSrfLanded = The readings indicate an iron core. This planet might have had a functioning geodynamo in the distant past.
		DunaSrfLanded = The instrument detects some very faint tremors.
		DunaSrfLanded = The seismograph barely responds. If this planet ever had seismic activity, it doesn't anymore.
		DunaSrfLanded = The planet seems to have a lot of seismic activity, mostly due to being pulled apart by Jool.
		DunaSrfLanded = Not much interesting happens when you run the seismic scan. Maybe the planet is geologically dead, or perhaps it is just having a nap.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		DunaFlyingHigh = Doing a cartwheel takes no effort. You accidentally hit a switch while spinning, hopefully it didn't do anything important.
		DunaFlyingLow = There doesn't seem to be any gravity here. You grab a towel that is floating by and stow it away.
		DunaSrfLanded = Picking up a Kerbin-sized hunk of rock is easy. If you entered a strongkerbal contest remotely, you would win gold!
		DunaSrfLanded = The gravity is high enough to walk but low enough for EVA packs to work like jet-packs. Colonizing here just got a lot more appealing.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[atmosphereAnalysis]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		DunaFlyingHigh = Carbon dioxide, with trace amounts of oxygen and nitrogen, are detected through spectroscopic analysis of the local atmosphere.
		DunaFlyingHigh = Although thin, Duna's atmosphere can be more than thick enough to aerobrake in.
		DunaFlyingLow = Much of the atmosphere is dust that's blown off the surface. That, or we forgot to clean the sensor before departure.
		DunaFlyingLow = This air is thin at best. The fine grains of dust that get caught in the intake don't help the scanner.
		DunaFlyingLow = Despite the dust storms, there's not much wind. The scanner indicates that the dust is incredibly small and easy to blow around.
		DunaFlyingLow = Lots of carbon dioxide. The high compressibility and low density might make re-entry heat less intense for landers.
		DunaFlyingLow = The air is so thin there's hardly any wind. You contemplate how well paper airplanes would work, absent-mindedly folding your mission papers into... *ahem.*
		DunaFlyingLow = The atmosphere here is largely devoid of the fine dust from the lower regions, but radiation levels are also higher.
		DunaFlyingLow = The atmosphere appears to be significantly less dense than that of Kerbin.
		DunaFlyingLow = It's very hard to take readings, as every few minutes you have to clear dust from the sensors.
		DunaSrfLanded = The carbon dioxide in the air is thick enough that it could be harvested for plants in greenhouses. Wait, what?
		DunaSrfLanded = You notice the Atmosphere Analyzer say the warranty is void, but you still think using it was a good idea.
		DunaSrfLanded = The surface pressure seems to vary wildly as the levels of carbon dioxide and water vapor change with the seasons.
		DunaSrfLanded = You fear the dust will never quite come out.
		DunaSrfLanded = Lots of carbon dioxide... and not much else. Extremophile plants could potentially live here.
		DunaSrfLanded = Mission Control says there's air here, but you can't breathe it. You wonder why Duna would even bother having one in that case. It's probably making fun of you or something.
