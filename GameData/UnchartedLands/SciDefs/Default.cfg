		default = You find a kettle in the supplies container and start to beg Mission Control the permission to stop what you are doing and have a cup of tea.
		default = The vastness of space is mind-boggling. It's crazy how many puddings could be stored with the advent of high-capacity dessert storage devices.
		default = "My leg is so itchy. And why does my suit smell like anchovies... Wait a minute... Are we recording?!"
		default = You look out the window and wonder where the nearest fast-food is.
		default = You didn't know there was a "Master Alarm"!

		default = Mission Control denies your request to use the radio antenna to prank call the pizza place.
		default = Mission Control assures you (again!) that no, you cannot get any pizza delivered to you.

		default = Your mind wanders as Mission Control drones on about "Dell Ta Vee" and what that has to do with space travel.

		default = "... In T minus 2... 1... " *ding* "Mission Control: We have burritos."
		default = You take this opportunity to add a chapter to your ongoing "Harry Potman" fan-fiction. Both of your followers will no doubt be excited to see how it develops.
		default = Mission Control is concerned that the crew's new navigation plan is unsound. "Second star to the right and straight on till morning" is not a very specific vector.

		default = You hear a loud thud on the hull of the spacecraft. You look intently at your gauges and readings and confirm there is no serious damage to the space craft.
		default = You report that you could use more fuel and space on the spacecraft. You begin to contemplate why they call it a spacecraft when there is hardly any space in here. It's more like a sardine can.

		default = You realize that most of these reports are horrible.
		default = When you gotta go, you gotta go. Who forgot to bring toilet paper?

		default = You pick up a large rock with great ease. Those hours in the gym have really paid off!
		default = You notice some small pebbles falling into a casing full of sensitive computer equipment and hope they don't get damaged from rattling around inside.
		default = The sample reveals complex artificial polymers often used in reinforced fabrics and plastics. Mission Control asks you to point the other end of the sampler at the ground.
		default = After kicking the ground a lot of times, you successfully create a small crater. You quickly fill it in before Mission Control yells at you.

		default = Aaron Kerman was best known for his heroic final efforts in discovering that the Mun has no atmosphere. Now we use these sensors instead.
		default = Yep. Works as specified.
