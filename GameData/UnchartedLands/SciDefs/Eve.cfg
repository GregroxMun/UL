		EveInSpaceHigh = Eve's sky glows a beautiful blue on the night side.
		EveInSpaceHigh = The atmosphere shimmers like rocket fuel.
		EveInSpaceHigh = Eve looks beautiful from up here. You suspect this to be a ruse to lull you into a false sense of security.
		EveInSpaceLow = What smells like burning?
		EveInSpaceLow = Well, red is your favorite color. Maybe there are red flowers you can take home?
		EveInSpaceLow = Those oceans look hot. You'd like to see the explosion if you landed in it.
		EveInSpaceLow = The world looks incredibly toxic and inhospitable.
		EveInSpaceLow = What smells like purple?
		EveFlyingHigh = After various tests you can confirm that it is indeed very pretty.
		EveFlyingLow = Super-heated oceans shimmer dangerously beneath the crushing atmosphere.
		EveFlyingLow = The crew wonders if there are enough snacks.
		EveFlyingLow = The equipment is strained to the limits. We should be fine, as long as we don't make any sudden movements.
		EveFlyingLow = You get a sudden urge for grape juice.
		EveFlyingLow = Both the wind and the crew are screaming.
		EveFlyingLow = They said that the crew would be getting a raise when they returned, but you've never heard of anyone getting a raise. Ever.
		EveSrfLanded = After hearing the creaks of your capsule you regret visiting Eve.
		EveSrfLanded = "I want to go home".
		EveSrfLanded = You feel that your ship is under a lot of pressure.
		EveSrfLanded = Maybe smuggling some snacks into the command module wasn't a bad idea, after all.
		EveSrfLanded = You start having second thoughts about landing...
		EveSrfLanded = We have successfully landed on Eve! However, the crew is expressing doubts about the landers ability to leave.
		EveSrfLanded = You still cherish the hope that you packed enough fuel.
		EveSrfLanded = Your crew asks Mission Control if snacks can be turned into fuel.
		EveSrfLanded = The gravity is getting to us.
		EveSrfLanded = You have a feeling that landing here may have been a bad idea.
		EveSrfSplashed = Even though your suit should be airtight, you swear that the capsule reeks faintly of nail polish remover.
		EveSrfSplashed = You see the liquid that is Eve's ocean leak into the capsule. You get the suspicion that you may be in big trouble.
		EveSrfSplashed = Mission Control assures you that it's safe outside and you can drink it without harm. You, however, become skeptical when it begins melting the paint off the ship.
		EveSrfSplashed = We're bouncing a bit too much here.
		EveSrfSplashed = The ocean is feeling a bit too hot...
		EveSrfSplashed = Short circuit in Wire Five!
		EveSrfSplashed = As you see the boiling ocean surrounding you, you start to wonder how you'll ever get back home.

	@RESULTS
	{
		EveInSpaceHigh = From this position you can clearly make out oceans of some kind around the surface below.
		EveInSpaceLow = "I left the stove on!"
		EveInSpaceLow = I feel like my helmet is dissolving. Oh wait... IT IS! Get me back in, now!
		EveInSpaceLow = "Come on, cosmos! Do your worst!"
		EveInSpaceLow = You wonder if you will ever be returning home. Probably not.
		EveInSpaceLow = "It has been an honor."
		EveFlyingLow = You wonder, supposing you let go, if the atmosphere is thick enough to allow you to fall gently to the ground like a feather.
		EveFlyingLow = The red behemoth dares you to slip.
		EveFlyingLow = The atmosphere is so thick you have a sneaking suspicion it may be made out of some kind of soup. Well, it wouldn't hurt to taste it... right?
		EveFlyingLow = "I will not give up, I will not give in! I will land boots down, I will stand again."
		EveFlyingLow = You start to think that it's entirely possible to swim in this atmosphere.
		EveSrfLanded = The toss of a pebble suggests that the atmosphere is REALLY, REALLY thick.
		EveSrfLanded = You decide to take a short walk, but think better of it after the first few steps.
		EveSrfLanded = You feel like you may have put on some weight.
		EveSrfLanded = You should have done more exercise back on Kerbin.
		EveSrfLanded = You wonder what jerk put lead weights in your suit.
		EveSrfLanded = "Should I take the left foot or the right foot?" The decision weighs heavy on your shoulders - literally.
		EveSrfLanded = The extreme pressure is making it hard to move. Thankfully, you can still wiggle your toes.
		EveSrfLanded = The thick atmosphere makes it difficult to move around. You swear that if not for the high gravity, you could hover a bit just by flapping your arms.
		EveSrfSplashed = You regret the decision of leaving the ship.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mysteryGoo]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		EveInSpaceHigh = The Goo is staring towards the planet. Is it homesick?
		EveInSpaceLow = The Goo indicates to you that it would prefer a different travel destination.
		EveFlyingHigh = The Goo has either completely disappeared or been bleached purple.
		EveFlyingLow = The Goo now appears like a straw blown painting. It looks distinctly red but so does everything else.
		EveSrfLanded = The Goo sits calmly bubbling away, showing no signs of being affected by a magnetic field. Maybe Eve releases gas from its surface to replace the atmosphere stripped away by the solar wind.
		EveSrfLanded = Looking relieved, the Goo slumps to the bottom of the container.
		EveSrfLanded = The Goo tries to escape, but can't seem to get up the sides of the container.
		EveSrfLanded = The Goo lumps up in the middle of the container. Is it afraid of falling out?
		EveSrfLanded = You look at the Goo and think that you see an image of a Kerbal. When you look back again, all you see is the standard routine of being crushed under the atmospheric pressure.
		EveSrfLanded = The Goo looks stressed. Perhaps it's under a lot of pressure?
		EveSrfLanded = The Goo looks very distressed.
		EveSrfLanded = The Goo has completely flattened against the bottom of the canister. A tendril extends slowly towards you, as if to say: "Can we go home now?"
		EveSrfLanded = The Goo is dense and viscous and sticks itself to the bottom of the canister.
		EveSrfSplashed = The Goo breaks free of the canister, excited for a swim. Upon contact with the liquid, however, it quickly returns and curls up in the corner.
		EveSrfSplashed = The Goo has escaped into the ocean and seems to be waving goodbye as it floats away.
		EveSrfSplashed = The Goo appears to have merged with the liquid.
		EveSrfSplashed = Some local fluids have seeped into the container. The Goo vehemently avoids the stuff.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[surfaceSample]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		EveSrfLanded = Ouch! It's hot!
		EveSrfLanded = You analyse the sample that turns out to be an amethyst.
		EveSrfLanded = The surface sample reveals a lot of interesting chemical compounds. They suggest that much of the body that hit Eve burned up before reaching the planet's surface.
		EveSrfLanded = The soil seems to be significantly heavier here.
		EveSrfLanded = You reflect that returning this 1 kilogram rock to Kerbin will require well over a ton of rocket fuel. Is it really worth it?
		EveSrfLanded = You accidentally drop the sample. Its fall seems cushioned by the atmosphere.
		EveSrfLanded = You try to analyse the sample as thoroughly as possible, since it probably isn't going back.
		EveSrfLanded = The sample seems compliant, at least for now. You decide to keep it away from the power cabinet just in case.
		EveSrfLanded = Bringing this home will be an extraordinary challenge.
		EveSrfLanded = This sample glows in the dark. You think that you should use the lead-lined sample box.
		EveSrfLanded = You pick up a basaltic rock. It seems to be eroded by wind and not by liquid.
		EveSrfLanded = You pick up a rock. It feels slightly molten and has an eroded look to it.
		EveSrfLanded = I've come all this way for THIS?
		EveSrfLanded = You try to pick up a rock the size of a bouncy-ball, but it seems to weigh more than 5 Kerbals.
		EveSrfSplashed = This bubbling liquid sample looks like your favorite soft drink. You are tempted to drink it.
		EveSrfSplashed = You find traces of liquid blutonium.
		EveSrfSplashed = You take a sample, and conclude that it is denser than Kerbin's core.
		EveSrfSplashed = You hope the sample canister can survive the pressure of Eve's atmosphere before you take it back home.
		EveSrfSplashed = This looks very very dangerous.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mobileMaterialsLab]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		EveInSpaceHigh = The materials bay, after an apparent deliberation, produces a liquid. It's almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea.
		EveInSpaceLow = All samples turn red out of fear.
		EveFlyingHigh = Ten out of ten samples agree: "The stuff below you is probably liquid."
		EveFlyingHigh = Even though you are still high in the planet's atmosphere, the samples are beginning to decompose due to the heat and pressure.
		EveFlyingLow = The samples are torn out of the container by the pressure of the atmosphere. Perhaps Kerbtape wasn't enough.
		EveSrfLanded = The gel samples begin to evaporate, making odd colored smoke. You suddenly wonder if this could be used to make colored exhaust.
		EveSrfLanded = When the materials bay was opened, most of the samples fell out. Some of them floated, and others sank. Fascinating!
		EveSrfLanded = The radioactivity has caused the blutonium samples to vaporize. Apart from that, everything is normal.
		EveSrfLanded = The materials that have not melted are one by one starting to catch fire. This probably has implications for space suit design.
		EveSrfSplashed = The oceans seem to be stripping the paint off of the lab's materials safety decals.
		EveSrfSplashed = The materials start to dissolve. The liquid here appears to be acidic.
		EveSrfSplashed = The materials look happy as they quickly dissolve in the mix of chemicals that make up this sea.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[temperatureScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		EveInSpaceLow = You detect a definite heat signature from the planet below.
		EveFlyingLow = The temperature is a balmy red.
		EveSrfLanded = The temperature is so hot that the thermometer wants to slap you in the face.
		EveSrfLanded = That's far too pleasant to be right. Maybe if you jiggle the cord... aha! There it goes.
		EveSrfLanded = The liquid in the thermometer seems to be frothing angrily.
		EveSrfLanded = Readings are off the charts, literally. Engineers in Mission Control hastily append another sheet of printer paper to them.
		EveSrfLanded = You're not sure if the temperature reading is accurate or if the gravity is so strong the mercury can't rise properly...
		EveSrfSplashed = It's pretty hot. The high pressure is the only thing stopping this ocean from boiling away.
		EveSrfSplashed = The temperature readings vary widely as waves roll over the sensor.
		EveSrfSplashed = The liquid appears to be radiating heat.
		EveSrfSplashed = The data suggests a suitable temperature for frying kalamari.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[barometerScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		EveFlyingHigh = The barometer is reading the same pressures as sea level on Kerbin. This would be fine, if not for how much of the sky is still below you.
		EveFlyingLow = The barometer makes a strange "pinging" sound as its sides bend inwards.
		EveFlyingLow = The pressure is high and the atmosphere is thick. You begin to wonder if this is going to be a one-way mission.
		EveFlyingLow = The barometer would be broken if not for its ability to move the decimal really far to the right.
		EveFlyingLow = You secretly wish your friends and family the best as landing here may be the last landing you'll ever make. 
		EveSrfLanded = The barometer rates the atmosphere "crushing".
		EveSrfLanded = Under pressure, pushing down on me, pushing down on you, pushing down on we.
		EveSrfLanded = You start laughing at the abnormally high reading as you realize you're going to be stuck here for a long time.
		EveSrfLanded = You calculate the amount of Delta-V just to escape the atmosphere is greater than that it took to both escape Kerbin's and get here!
		EveSrfLanded = You tap the glass of the barometer. Nope, it's not broken.
		EveSrfLanded = It's buried the needle!
		EveSrfLanded = The barometer doesn't seem to like it here.
		EveSrfLanded = As the data from the barometer comes in, you start to feel very unsure about sending any Kerbals there.
		EveSrfLanded = The pressure is cursing down here! You start to worry if you will ever get back up again.
		EveSrfLanded = The barometer is spitting out overflow errors.
		EveSrfLanded = The barometer still gives pressure readings, but it may not do so for long.
		EveSrfLanded = The instrument shows you an extremely high pressure and then refuses to work anymore.
		EveSrfLanded = You hear a hissing sound, like something is leaking.
		EveSrfSplashed = The pressure is very high. You wonder how high would it be at the bottom of this purple sea.
		EveSrfSplashed = The needle spins wildly before the device caves in and begins to fizz.
		EveSrfSplashed = Atmosphere? Yes!

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[seismicScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		EveSrfLanded = A strange echoing effect is apparent. It could be a sign of underground cavities buried deep beneath the surface.
		EveSrfLanded = The scan yields a great deal of important information.
		EveSrfLanded = The scan hints at Eve's crust structure.
	}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		EveInSpaceHigh = The sensor spikes every time you orbit over an ocean.
		EveInSpaceLow = The high gravity will make even short falls hazardous. Kerbals should be careful here.
		EveSrfLanded = The gravity of Eve strongly supports your personal "Planet Core is a Black Hole" theory.
		EveSrfLanded = The gravity here makes you feel really fat, while at the same time, you look quite skinny.
		EveSrfLanded = Just looking at the readout makes you feel heavier.
		EveSrfLanded = The sensor's overload warning is on. It appears Eve's gravity is almost too much.
		EveSrfSplashed = You feel lucky you aren't sinking.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[atmosphereAnalysis]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		EveFlyingHigh = Heavy gasses in high concentrations. Atmospheric entry takes quite a toll on ships here.
		EveFlyingHigh = The thick atmosphere clogs the sensor.
		EveFlyingHigh = You eagerly stare at the readout, but sadly, it displays a list of deadly gasses, not exactly what you were hoping for.
		EveFlyingHigh = The sensor is detecting a cloud of super-heated water vapor.
		EveFlyingHigh = Some of the sensors indicate large concentrations of sulfur dioxide. Mission Control insists that, despite containing oxygen, this gas isn't breathable.
		EveFlyingHigh = The highly corrosive gasses start stripping the sensor array. You're thankful the engineers made it durable or it would have been torn apart by now.
		EveFlyingLow = It's thick, and full of hot air. What did you expect?
		EveFlyingLow = The air is very dense here... You wonder why that is.
		EveFlyingLow = If not for the high gravity, you could fly aircraft here at very low speeds.
		EveFlyingLow = Why is the interior of the instrument turning red?
		EveSrfLanded = You now are completely certain that this is a weird color.
		EveSrfLanded = Taking a "fresh breath of air" is not the best idea according to this atmosphere analysis!
		EveSrfLanded = As you analyse the pressure around you, you start to feel very hesitant about sending any Kerbals out there.
		EveSrfLanded = The air is acidic enough to wear away some of the labels on the sensors.
		EveSrfLanded = For a beautiful planet and the pearl of the Kerbol system, such bad air is a complete disappointment.
		EveSrfLanded = The air is heavy, hot, and not particularly friendly.
