	@RESULTS
	{
		GillyInSpaceHigh = Somehow your foot has become stuck in the controls. Who has been chewing gum?
		GillyInSpaceHigh = Yup. It's tiny.
		GillyInSpaceHigh = In retrospect, you imagined it to be bigger.
		GillyInSpaceHigh = How cute! Despite its hazardous appearance, Gilly is an adorable little asteroid.
		GillyInSpaceLow = "I didn't know they made them this small."
		GillyInSpaceLow = You wonder if anything would have a TWR of less than one here.
		GillyInSpaceLow = What is this, a moon for ants?
		GillyInSpaceLow = This place looks a bit boring. You start calculating what it would take to deorbit it into Kerbol, until your calculator gives you a NaN error. Mission Control refuses to do calculations for you.
		GillyInSpaceLow = It looks small and not very tasty.
		GillyInSpaceLow = You look down to the surface. It's so close!
		GillyInSpaceLow = You think you can stick your arm out and touch the surface.
		GillySrfLanded = You feel no change in gravity.
		GillySrfLanded = You contemplate running around the circular walls of the crew capsule like a caffeinated hamster, to see if it would generate enough force to tip over the lander.
		GillySrfLanded = You consider going for a hike, but you are afraid that your first step will launch you off the surface.
		GillySrfLanded = You feel a surge in gravity. Mentioning nothing to Mission Control, you put on your brown pants.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[evaReport]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		GillyInSpaceHigh = Looking down, you see a speck of dust. As you are about to record the sight, you realize that it is, in fact, Gilly.
		GillyInSpaceLow = You wonder how awesome it would be to make a jump with a rover from the hills here.
		GillyInSpaceLow = You try to touch a passing peak. Mission Control tells you to go back into your capsule and raise your damn orbit.
		GillySrfLanded = You become concerned that the rock you threw away may loop all the way around Gilly and hit you in the back of your head.
		GillySrfLanded = "Wait... there's a planet below me?"
		GillySrfLanded = If only the launchpad had been here instead of KSC, this whole space thing would've been so much easier. You make a note to berate the administrators back home over their poor choice.
		GillySrfLanded = If that was 'one small step', you don't want to imagine how big a 'giant leap' would be in this gravity.
		GillySrfLanded = Using your RCS systems for balance, you manage to walk along the surface using only two fingers.
		GillySrfLanded = You make a mental note of how light you feel and then deduce that it may be best to keep both feet on the surface.
		GillySrfLanded = You probably shouldn't jump. You might not come back down.
		GillySrfLanded = That rock you threw is still going...

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mysteryGoo]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		GillyInSpaceHigh = The Goo begins to spin around inside its canister, and it looks like its rapidly changing colors.
		GillyInSpaceHigh = The Goo looks incredulous.
		GillyInSpaceLow = The Goo has turned into a hard cone. You wonder if it could hold some snacks?
		GillyInSpaceLow = For a brief moment, the Goo defies all known laws of physics and takes the shape of a 4-D hyper-cube. Attempting to comprehend this only succeeds in giving you a headache.
		GillySrfLanded = The Goo is acting like it's about to go home.
		GillySrfLanded = The Goo rolls placidly around the container.
		GillySrfLanded = The Goo has clumped up into a spheroid and become slightly brittle.
		GillySrfLanded = You don't think the Goo has any trust in Gilly.
		GillySrfLanded = The Goo slowly bounces up and down in the canister; it isn't sure if its in space or on a moon.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[surfaceSample]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		GillySrfLanded = You feel like you could almost fit this whole body into the container.
		GillySrfLanded = You have a hard time picking up some dust samples as it flies out of your scoop and into the sky.
		GillySrfLanded = You've found great amounts of carbon, but where are the diamonds?
		GillySrfLanded = The chondrules in the regolith remind you of white chocolate chip brownies.
		GillySrfLanded = This sample may contain the secrets of the formation of the Solar System! Or it might just be a bit of dirt and rocks...
		GillySrfLanded = Taking a surface sample in low gravity is kinda tricky. As you dig the shovel in, the reaction force sends you flying upwards.
		GillySrfLanded = The surface is composed of loose rock of various sizes.
		GillySrfLanded = Carborundum - clear evidence that Gilly was once subjected to a whole lot of "boom boom".
		GillySrfLanded = Your Geiger counter clicks too many times to warrant keeping this sample.
		GillySrfLanded = You do a little show and tell with a huge boulder to Mission Control before they tell you to grab an actual sample.
		GillySrfLanded = You pick up a rock. It looks so dull that you throw it away in irritation.
		GillySrfLanded = As you lift the rock, the dust underneath it reaches escape velocity.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mobileMaterialsLab]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		GillyInSpaceHigh = The samples behave in much the same way that they did while in deep space.
		GillyInSpaceLow = It looks like someone's been trying to hide snacks in the Materials Lab.
		GillySrfLanded = When disturbed, the objects take a long time to return to the floor in a new and interesting pattern. You wonder if you could sell the Materials Lab as a piece of modern art.
		GillySrfLanded = Some of the samples float out of the materials bay.
	}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[temperatureScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		GillySrfLanded = You were expecting results from Gilly to be interesting... You note your disappointment with the body's boringly cold surface.
		GillySrfLanded = Gilly is chilly.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[seismicScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		GillySrfLanded = So far, the only seismic readings are those caused by you bouncing off the walls of the cabin.
		GillySrfLanded = You fear your vessel has altered Gilly's course.
		GillySrfLanded = Gilly seems to be seismically as dead as a doorknob.
		GillySrfLanded = The body is so small and dead that the only noteworthy reading you get is an echo of your own landing bouncing back from the far side.
		GillySrfLanded = There is no activity on this barren rock.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		GillyInSpaceHigh = Hey, is this thing on?
		GillyInSpaceLow = Are you sure the sensor's even working? The numbers are so small they don't register on the cheap LCD.
		GillyInSpaceLow = The gravity scanner can't decide which way is up.
		GillySrfLanded = Peering very closely at the dial, you notice there's indeed some gravity here.
		GillySrfLanded = The needle on the gravity sensor seems to have moved about half a millimeter.
		GillySrfLanded = With Gilly's low gravity, you now question why Jeb wanted to put Mainsails on the lander.
		GillySrfLanded = You have to tap the sensor a few times before it realizes that gravity is, in fact, present.
		GillySrfLanded = The instrument hardly recognizes the body below.
