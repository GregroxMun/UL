		MunInSpaceHigh = You take the time to study the schematics of your spacecraft. You are greatly impressed and slightly worried at how many corners were cut during its design and construction.
		MunInSpaceHigh = As you approach the Mun, you take the time to rehearse several contingency plans in case of an emergency.
		MunInSpaceHigh = You take out your sketchbook and make a drawing of the munar surface. Then you give it a smiley face so it looks happy to see you!
		MunInSpaceHigh = Watching the pockmarked munar surface get larger and larger as you get closer and closer is a sight you'll treasure forever. 
		MunInSpaceHigh = All systems nominal. The ship is happy so you're happy.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Staring at the crater-filled surface of the Mun you are suddenly thankful for Kerbin's thick atmosphere.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Huh. The Mun kinda looks like a giant golf ball. You nervously keep an eye out for a giant golf club.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Wow the Mun looks pretty beat up. Look at all those holes.
		MunInSpaceHigh = The crater below reminds you of snacks.  Of course everything reminds you of snacks.
		MunInSpaceHigh = You gaze down at the crater below as crumbs from the snack you are eating fall out of your mouth.
		MunInSpaceHigh = You are very proud of yourself for reaching this far!
		MunInSpaceHigh = What kind of geologic formation is THAT?
		MunInSpaceHigh = You look back at Kerbin. It looks rather small.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Ha the Mun is so small and adorab--holy crap, it's getting big really fast.
		MunInSpaceHigh = It seems that the Mun is one big giant rock with no atmosphere.
		MunInSpaceHigh = "Here I am floating in a tin can, far above the Mun."
		MunInSpaceHigh = You wonder if those craters were caused by the impacts of launches before you. Mission Control laughs nervously and urges you otherwise.
		MunInSpaceLow = Nothing to report Mission Control! Except for the fact that we're flying over the Mun but you already know that.
		MunInSpaceLow = The crew is incredibly impressed with the engineering of this spacecraft. They especially admire the cleverly-recessed, climate-controlled snack bar.
		MunInSpaceLow = The Mun's Polar Lowlands don't seem that different from the rest of the Mun.
		MunInSpaceLow = You report that the ship makes scary noises at night and you can't sleep. Mission Control advises leaving on the night light.
		MunInSpaceLow = You thank Mission Control for helping you get this far.
		MunInSpaceLow = In addition to the rather round craters, there also appear to be areas that are far more irregular in shape. The scientists are calling these 'basins'.
		MunInSpaceLow = You remember watching a documentary on one of the leading theories explaining the formation of the Mun. It's hard to believe that the sterile surface below was once a literal sea of fire.
		MunInSpaceLow = Without atmosphere, weather, or major seismic activity, the Mun's craters are remarkably well-preserved. You make sure to take plenty of pictures and note this in your report.
		MunInSpaceLow = Crew report begins. I'm hungry. Will eat snacks. Crew report ends.
		MunInSpaceLow = You try to decide which area would make the best landing spot. Then you make a back-up list of places that would make a good crash-landing spot.
		MunInSpaceLow = ANOTHER crater?! Does this place have ANY flat land??
		MunInSpaceLow = You glance out your window at the surface... Whoa! Who put mountains this high on a rock this small?!
		MunInSpaceLow = Your ships suffers a minor de-pressurization, but quick thinking and lots of bubble gum manage to solve the problem before it gets out of hand.
		MunInSpaceLow = "Crew reporting in. We are currently near the Mun. It turns out it's much bigger than we thought it was."
		MunInSpaceLow = Great, we've made it this far! Now, how to land? 
		MunInSpaceLow = You don't know if the crater rims would be a good landing site. Probably not, but they would certainly be... interesting.
		MunSrfLanded = The crew cannot stop hyperventilating.
		MunSrfLanded = You put on your polarized aviator sunglasses. Now you can look cool AND be situationally appropriate.		
		MunSrfLanded = It feels strangely dangerous out there. Mission Control insists it's safe, but you don't think they would know very well.
		MunSrfLanded = Another place to gain the 'First snack ever eaten here in the history of Kerbalkind' achievement. Let's get to it!
		MunSrfLanded = You survey the vista that spreads out before you as you munch on some snacks.		
		MunSrfLanded = Struck by a sudden urge to say something witty, you nearly choke on your snack.
		MunSrfLanded = Boy, the lighting up here sure looks weird. Almost as if you were on a sound stage or something.
		MunSrfLanded = You begin to indicate concerns regarding whether or not the landing was simply an elaborate hoax, but the communications are interrupted by a strange voice telling you to keep quiet.		
		MunSrfLanded = One small step for man, one giant bill for mankind.

		MunInSpaceHigh = You inspect your craft from the outside, going through the maintenance checklist provided by Mission Control. 
		MunInSpaceHigh = You hear a sudden hissing from your space suit. Thankfully, it turns out it was just the snacks from last night.
		MunInSpaceHigh = You roam around the outside of your craft, marvelling at how such a contraption managed to get you this far.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Huh the Mun looks surprisingly like the one in your high school textbook. Probably the end result of hundreds of years of Kerbal curiosity. And telescopes. Really big telescopes.
		MunInSpaceHigh = As you carry out your EVA you feel your nose get progressively itchier. The resulting sneeze almost spins you out of control.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Mission Control insists on guiding you step-by-step through this spacewalk. As a small act of rebellion, you do everything upside-down. They'll never know! Even you can't tell if you're really upside-down or not.
		MunInSpaceHigh = You wonder if there's someone back on Kerbin watching the Mun through a telescope right now. You wave a few times in case they can see you.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Well there she is. You should probably rehearse your awesome, historic speech before you land.
		MunInSpaceHigh = You gave up counting the craters when you ran out of fingers for the ninth time.
		MunInSpaceHigh = You stare through the not-so-vast expanse between you and the Mun.  Who knew it was this big.
		MunInSpaceHigh = It looks like a really big rock.
		MunInSpaceLow = Aw, the Mun doesn't have auroras... Oh hey, you can see Kerbin's from here!
		MunInSpaceLow = If this was Kerbin, you'd be seeing ice sheets by now. Oh well, EVAs are still fun.
		MunInSpaceLow = Despite being relatively flat, the surface is still littered with debris from impact ejecta, making choosing a landing site a non-trivial matter.
		MunInSpaceLow = After you complete your allotted activities, you let go of the ship and float freely over the Mun's surface.
		MunInSpaceLow = You wish you brought a skateboard. Those crater walls would make an awesome halfpipe.
		MunSrfLanded = You really want to jump again, but last time Mission Control yelled at you.
		MunSrfLanded = That dust is getting into everything! Now stop staring and help me clean my visor!
		MunSrfLanded = You hum "You never make me be like you/I'm master of the moon."
		MunSrfLanded = You are amazed at how mystifying the moon scenery looks like from the pole.
		MunSrfLanded = You confirm that the Mun is not made out of cheese. Mission Control is very sad.
		MunSrfLanded = Feeling slightly bored, you play peek-a-boo with Kerbin over the crater edges.
		MunSrfLanded = You should have brought your golf club.
		MunSrfLanded = "Did I leave the keys in the ignition?"
		MunSrfLanded = As you step off your lander, saying the usual dramatic speech, Mission Control calls up, tells you to cut the chatter and to take the all-important surface sample.
		MunSrfLanded = You look up and hope that the rocket scientists back on Kerbin did their math correctly.
		MunSrfLanded = Yep, it's a crater all right. You've noted this down on your checklist with a smiley face. Science is fun!
		MunSrfLanded = You wonder how that rock got into your spaceboot.
		MunSrfLanded = There was something you were going to say, and even though you spent the entire trip over here perfecting your delivery, you've somehow managed to forget it.
		MunSrfLanded = That's one small step fo- the situation is nominal.
		MunSrfLanded = That's one small step for a Kerbal, and one big cupboard of snacks for said Kerbal.
		MunSrfLanded = You notice some weird rocks in the distance.
		MunSrfLanded = You're in a most peculiar way, and the stars look very different today.
		MunSrfLanded = A small rock cracks your visor. You begin to question EVA on a surface with no atmosphere. 
		MunSrfLanded = You spot a narrow part of the canyon, and wonder if you could make the jump across.
		MunSrfLanded = You hold your hand up against Kerbin, and use your thumb to blot out the sun. After thinking briefly about pale blue dots, the puniness of kerbalkind, and philosophy, you go back to wondering how sweet it would be to ramp off those dunes back there.

		MunInSpaceHigh = The Goo is completely inactive, even with applied stimulation. Did you bring the right canister?
		MunInSpaceHigh = The Goo doesn't want to eat its vegetables. Mission Control advises you to use the "Here comes the airplane" approach.
		MunInSpaceHigh = The Goo has recently been showing signs of homicidal tendencies. You lock it back in its canister and hope for the best.
		MunInSpaceHigh = The Goo has eaten your snack! What part of "Do Not Touch", did it not understand?
		MunInSpaceHigh = The Goo is snoring, so you quietly shut the canister and decide to take a nap yourself. 
		MunInSpaceHigh = Your next experiment is an attempt to determine whether the Goo needs rest. This might take a while...
		MunInSpaceHigh = The Mun appears to captivate the Goo's attention. Once can only guess what it thinks of this historic journey.
		MunInSpaceHigh = The Goo has found your hidden snack stash! Unfortunately it seems that its appetite matches your own.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Hmm the Goo seems to react well to various sound patterns. You decide to play some music and are utterly shocked when it gets up and starts doing the Carlton.
		MunInSpaceHigh = You try to divide the goo into several parts. It easily flows around your clumsy fingers and forms back into its original shape.
		MunInSpaceHigh = The Goo stares into your very soul. This is gonna be an awkward flight.
		MunInSpaceHigh = The Goo is lonely and asks for a hug.
		MunInSpaceHigh = The Goo is bouncing off the walls.  Who knows why.

		MunInSpaceHigh = The Goo seems to enjoy itself.
		MunInSpaceHigh = It's amusing to watch The Goo bounce around.
		MunInSpaceHigh = You very briefly consider filling one of those canyons with Goo.
		MunInSpaceLow = The Goo is quick to adjust to munar orbit gravity. Quicker than you, in fact.
		MunInSpaceLow = The Goo insists on a gluten-free diet. You promise it that all snacks on board are indeed free of those horrible, nasty gluten things.
		MunInSpaceLow = The Goo scoffs at your pathetic attempts to understand its nature.
		MunInSpaceLow = The Goo is trying to unlatch the airlock. You manage to stop it just in time.
		MunInSpaceLow = You explain to the Goo that it should be honoured it was chosen for this historic journey. It seems to stand a little straighter.
		MunInSpaceLow = The Goo has decided that your cause is worthy, and has committed to your quest to one day land on the Mun. +1 companion.
		MunInSpaceLow = The Goo immediately makes a break for the munar surface. However, its blob form doesn't seem too suited for the job and it just ends up floating helplessly some distance from the craft.
		MunInSpaceLow = The Goo splats itself across the viewport, shocking you out of your reverie.
		MunInSpaceLow = The Goo is obscuring the viewport and refusing to move. You have no choice but activate the specially-installed windshield wipers.
		MunInSpaceLow = The Goo demands to be taken seriously and you dutifully refrain from snorting juice out of your nose every time it tries to dance.
		MunInSpaceLow = The Goo challenges you to a race to the munar surface! You laugh and lock it back inside its canister. Little do you know, a small piece of it has snuck into your suit...
		MunInSpaceLow = In today's experiment, you will observe the Goo to see if it can spontaneously reproduce. Hmm this could take a while...
		MunInSpaceLow = The Goo ripples and jiggles and suddenly forms itself into a remarkably accurate miniature Mun.
		MunInSpaceLow = The Goo cowers in its container, afraid that your ship may be the next addition to the crater below.
		MunInSpaceLow = The Goo demands a medal for being the first non-Kerbal in EVA around the Mun.
		MunInSpaceLow = The Goo looks like a bowl as it imitates the crater below.
		MunInSpaceLow = The Goo melts into a welcoming ball.
		MunInSpaceLow = The surface of the Goo has become covered with little craters.
		MunInSpaceLow = The Goo seems as excited as you are at being this close to the Mun.
		MunSrfLanded = The Goo is bouncing from one crater to the other like flubber.		
		MunSrfLanded = The Goo seems to be imitating the paparazzi, following you around and constantly flashing like it's taking pictures of you.		
		MunSrfLanded = The Goo shows signs of bipolar behavior.
		MunSrfLanded = The Goo has become a slightly tubular structure.
		MunSrfLanded = The Goo seems to be trying to do the limbo under one of the landing struts. Strange stuff, that Goo.		
		MunSrfLanded = The Goo seems to have split in two and moved to opposite ends of its container.		
		MunSrfLanded = You call the Goo a goober. It completely ignores you. So does Mission Control.		
		MunSrfLanded = The Goo is as giddy as a schoolgirl.
		MunSrfLanded = The Goo is no less gooey here than elsewhere. Strange stuff.		
		MunSrfLanded = The Goo just hangs out in its container.  Even when you poke it with your finger.
		MunSrfLanded = The Goo rolls around and around the rim of the crater, slowly moving toward the lowest part in the center.		
		MunSrfLanded = The Goo is happy to be on the far side of anything.  Especially if it isn't actively crashing into it.		
		MunSrfLanded = The Goo seems to have gotten dirty. Did anyone bring a duster?
		MunSrfLanded = The Goo sits there contentedly. You're not sure how an inanimate Goo can be content, but that really is the only way to describe it.

		MunSrfLanded = This area has a particularly high concentration of rare elements. Nice!
		MunSrfLanded = Continual samples of this area confirm it is rich in useful materials.
		MunSrfLanded = You dig around for a nice sample of the crater, carefully selecting some of everything.
		MunSrfLanded = The sample appears to be radioactive.
		MunSrfLanded = There appears to be layers of completely different materials here. It's possible this site has had multiple impacts.
		MunSrfLanded = You wonder if this would make a nice snack.
		MunSrfLanded = It's a cold piece of soil. As cold as ice. Wait.
		MunSrfLanded = You examine the rocks you have collected. Upon further investigation, you realize that there is a strange weight to one of them, it does not feel like it has the same weight as the other rocks you've collected and seems hollow. You promptly place it into a sample container.
		MunSrfLanded = The samples here show lower concentrations of ejecta. There appears to be some liquids in the soil that have frozen permanently.
		MunSrfLanded = The sample seems to contain frozen liquids... we should send them back to Kerbin for further analysis.
		MunSrfLanded = Samples from this location seem to show intense shock patterns.
		MunSrfLanded = You examine the sample you've collected, and throw it into the container for further testing.
		MunSrfLanded = It appears that some of the samples are magnetic and show a faint alignment.
		MunSrfLanded = The ground materials appear to be a combination of basaltic rocks and breccia.
		MunSrfLanded = Deeper samples seems to contain more fragmented and shattered formations of rock.
		MunSrfLanded = The sample contains evidence of a weak, localized magnetic field.
		MunSrfLanded = The surface here consists of multiple types of rock. Some appear almost crystalline.
		MunSrfLanded = The ground appears to be made of very small, sharp, abrasive pieces of gray rock. It would probably be best if you didn't rub your space suit against the stuff.
		MunSrfLanded = Very... rocky.
		MunSrfLanded = The sample contains odd glass spherules of various colors. They're quite pretty!
		MunSrfLanded = The patterning of this surface sample is particularly interesting.
		MunSrfLanded = As you sample the crater you can't help but feel bad for the Mun. It's been beaten up pretty bad by these impacts.
		MunSrfLanded = You dig around in the surface of the crater, looking for something neat.
		MunSrfLanded = You find a really cool looking rock and decide to keep it. Then, you throw a less cool looking rock into the sample container.
		MunSrfLanded = You take a small rock and your nine iron, place the rock on a tee, and knock it into low orbit.
		MunSrfLanded = The Mun dust here is light and thin... It's very poor sandcastle-building material. That doesn't stop you from making one.
		MunSrfLanded = The sample appears to be comprised of a large number of materials that have layered over time.
		MunSrfLanded = The sample has low amounts of basaltic rock. This might account for the changes in coloration we've seen.
		MunSrfLanded = Seems muddy, in a waterless kind of way. You find it appropriate to remove your shoes before boarding the ship again, no thought given to the problems of removing space attire while still outside.
		MunSrfLanded = The crater seems to contain materials from lower layers of the surface.
		MunSrfLanded = These samples appear to be quite old compared to others we've taken.
		MunSrfLanded = You sample the dark surface of the crater. This should help determine what type of object hit here.
		MunSrfLanded = This crater seems to filled with useful materials in high concentration. What luck!
		MunSrfLanded = Samples from this location appear to be similar in makeup to the powdery surface of the Mun.
		MunSrfLanded = This crater must have had a really nasty impact, the samples are heavier than normal.
		MunSrfLanded = You're glad that the Mun's gravity is so low. Digging is backbreaking work!
		MunSrfLanded = The sample contains a combination of breccia and melted materials.
		MunSrfLanded = There are high concentrations of metals in this crater.
		MunSrfLanded = Done and dusted.
		MunSrfLanded = You suddenly realize why the physical examination screened for breathing problems.
		MunSrfLanded = The dust seems to be ionized due to long-term exposure to sunlight without an atmosphere to filter it. It sticks to your suit.
		MunSrfLanded = Finally, something that isn't dirt: a rock!
		MunSrfLanded = So, breccias are actually kind of boring.
		MunSrfLanded = This rock has tiny craters on it. Neat!
		MunSrfLanded = The lead scientists back at KSP decide against your idea to grill your sample between two pieces of bread. 
		MunSrfLanded = Samples in this location are striated. It's possible that the surface has fractured here.

		MunInSpaceHigh = Your experiment involves several high-powered lasers, which never ceases to amuse you.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Your samples seem to be doing well so far on this journey. You wonder if they are as excited as you are to get to the Mun.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Your current experiment spontaneously combusts. Good thing you have more! Now where did we go wrong last time? 
		MunInSpaceHigh = Zero-gravity experiments are messy! You wish there was sort of space vacuum you can use. Your gaze falls on the airlock and something clicks in your head. Hmm...
		MunInSpaceHigh = Laboratory work is lots of fun! You can just leave things floating around instead of putting them away!
		MunInSpaceHigh = Just another day at the lab... Oh wait, no it isn't! You're flying over the Mun!
		MunInSpaceHigh = Your lab is going through materials at an alarming rate. Perhaps you shouldn't have replaced the entire bottom rack with snacks.
		MunInSpaceHigh = You decide to put off writing your report until you reach the dark side of the Mun. There won't be much to see and you'll be able to concentrate better.
		MunInSpaceHigh = This particular experiment is from an elementary science class that won a national contest. Neat!
		MunInSpaceHigh = You finish your lab report in time to catch a glimpse of the huge Farside  down below.
		MunInSpaceHigh = It's getting very difficult to keep track of your experiments as they float around in the low gravity. Maybe you shouldn't have tried to them all at once.
		MunInSpaceHigh = You fill your lab report with scribbled images of you planting a flag on the Mun (not to scale). You hope the folks back at KSC get the hint.
		MunInSpaceHigh = The samples ask to be woken up when you're on the Mun.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Why are we in a lab up here when we could be playing....erm, EVA-ing, in the craters below?
		MunInSpaceHigh = Your lab report is strategically written to convince the KSC to let you land on the Mun.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Solar radiation reflected off the Mun's surface adds an interesting new angle to your science experiments.
		MunInSpaceLow = In today's experiment you observe your pet hamster's activities while in munar orbit gravity.
		MunInSpaceLow = There seems to be an argument at Mission Control over which experiment to do first. You sit back and eat some snacks while waiting for them to decide.
		MunInSpaceLow = Ah it's so nice to have your own laboratory far from the restrictions of Kerbin. No gravity and especially no safety supervisor!
		MunInSpaceLow = The materials bay door jams. You give it a few swift kicks until it pops open.
		MunInSpaceLow = An experiment in munar orbit, how exciting! You can't wait to see how they compare with the results from Kerbin orbit.
		MunInSpaceLow = Experimentation over the Mun has some interesting variances from experimentation above Kerbin.
		MunInSpaceLow = The instructions on the materials bay claim that the samples inside can be used as an emergency food supply. You hope you brought enough snacks.
		MunInSpaceLow = Watching the surface below, you can't help but think how great it would be if you had a munar surface sample to study using the equipment in your lavishly-equipped lab.
		MunInSpaceLow = You pick a sample at random and subject it to a plethora of scientific examinations including the time-tested method of sticking it in your mouth to see what it tastes like. 
		MunInSpaceLow = Oh dear, it seems that you have misplaced your snack inside the materials bay. Now you can't tell what's edible and what's not.
		MunInSpaceLow = The materials lab is ready for action! You, however, need a snack first to get you going.
		MunInSpaceLow = Your material tests indicate that similar metals brought into contact with one another form a strong bond when in vacuum. That should lead to some interesting developments in spaceflight. 
		MunInSpaceLow = You are too busy doodling the crater below to finish your lab experiments, so you send the doodle back to KSC instead of your report..
		MunInSpaceLow = You gaze down at the crater below, absentmindedly stirring a flask of some unnamed substance.
		MunInSpaceLow = You hear repeated cries of "Are we there yet?" coming from the materials bay.
		MunSrfLanded = Perched between the two craters the materials seem to be divided equally in their containers.  You note this in your report.	
		MunSrfLanded = The lab is cozy with the light reflecting off the crater outside.  You pull out a box of snacks and get to work on it.  Working on the labwork will come later.		
		MunSrfLanded = Mobile Materials Lab - Mun Report: Why did we bring this thing instead of more snacks? Thanks. - Signed, The Crew. 		
		MunSrfLanded = You aren't quite sure of what to make of the lab results.  Guess the scientists back on Kerbin can figure it out.		
		MunSrfLanded = All the materials are polarized and sticking together.  Is there ANYTHING that's not difficult in space?!		
		MunSrfLanded = All the materials seem to be squished to the bottom of their containers.  It takes you a while to complete your experiments.		
		MunSrfLanded = The munar soil has mixed with one of the materials, producing a gray paste that is getting everywhere.
		MunSrfLanded = You find it difficult to finish your report with everything at an angle.  There were so many craters around it was impossible to find a level landing site.		
		MunSrfLanded = The vista from here is very distracting, so it takes you some extra time to complete your report.
		MunSrfLanded = As you complete your lab reports you look forward to EVA-ing and running down the slope of the craters to see how fast you can get going.		
		MunSrfLanded = Working in a lab in a crater on the moon would make you feel like a mad scientist. You note this in your report.		
		MunSrfLanded = The materials promptly roll down the hill to the lowest part of the crater as soon as you open the canister.  You guess that's why its a 'Mobile Materials' Lab.
		MunSrfLanded = The materials promptly turn into a gooey mess from all the dust flying around at the surface.
		MunSrfLanded = As you look away, one sample makes a run for it.
		MunSrfLanded = For a moment, one of the materials reflects a black shape somewhere on the distant surface.

		MunInSpaceLow = The thermometer is reading the space outside as rather warm. That can't be right... Oh wait, you're sitting on it.
		MunInSpaceLow = The Mun doesn't seem to retain the Sun's warmth very well. Thermometer readings on the bright side are still pretty darn cold.
		MunInSpaceLow = You have lost the thermometer. You make up some data with impressive-looking figures to send back to KSC. Bigger numbers are better, right?
		MunInSpaceLow = Temperatures here are well within expectations. Still, it's better to have the hard data to confirm.
		MunInSpaceLow = The temperature in orbit low around the Mun is much as that of outer space. Perhaps because technically it's outer space.
		MunInSpaceLow = The temperature shifts ever so slowly as you pass sedately over the munar surface.
		MunInSpaceLow = The thermometer barely moves so you give it a good swift kick.
		MunInSpaceLow = You use the thermometer to bake your snack at the perfect temperature. Then you send readings back to Mission Control just how they react.
		MunInSpaceLow = Well that was quite expected. You consider throwing the thermometer into the microwave just to shake things up.
		MunInSpaceLow = You quickly write down your results in the knowledge that thermometers don't often respond well to lithobraking maneuvers.
		MunInSpaceLow = The temperature here is wholly uninteresting compared to the box of snacks in your hand.
		MunInSpaceLow = You read the thermal data and sadly put away your flip-flops.
		MunInSpaceLow = While waiting for the temperature scan to finish, you sketch the patterns made by the Mun's craters.

		MunSrfLanded = The thermometer pressure vessel seems to have sprung a leak, and all the liquid inside boiled off into space.  Hope the same thing doesn't happen to the rest of the ship.		
		MunSrfLanded = Seems like a great snack-time temperature.  Let's make it happen!		
		MunSrfLanded = It's pretty cold here. You'd almost think Kerbol hadn't shined here since it was formed!
		MunSrfLanded = The inclined angle of the solar radiation at this latitude has a marked effect on the temperature, which you make note of in your report.		
		MunSrfLanded = The blackened rocks absorb and radiate large quantities of the Sun's heat. You briefly consider the idea of sunbathing, but realize you don't have a beach towel. Oh well...
		MunSrfLanded = The surface here seems to reflect much of the Sun's heat. As a result, it's slightly cooler here.
		MunSrfLanded = You're unsure about the surrounding area, but your temperature is definitely elevated after that landing.  Wooohooo!		
		MunSrfLanded = The temperature reminds you how nice it really is back on Kerbin.		
		MunSrfLanded = The long shadows cast by the crater rims make this region colder than the surrounding highlands.
		MunSrfLanded = It's chilly. You want to take a walk around to warm up.

		MunSrfLanded = The scans indicate a large series of quakes incoming! Oh wait, your hand brushed the sensor. False alarm.
		MunSrfLanded = The sensor seems clogged from all the Munar dust. You give up and have a snack.
		MunSrfLanded = The Mun appears to be geologically dead. All you can detect are the slight tremors generated by meteorite impacts.
		MunSrfLanded = You carefully place the sensor down on the dusty surface and pat it on the top. 'Now there's a good little sensor.'
		MunSrfLanded = The instrument registers a small anomaly. You aren't sure if this was a genuine seismic event or just a false positive from you shuffling your feet.
		MunSrfLanded = The ground appears to have many small fractures from the multiple impacts, causing slight distortions in readings.
		MunSrfLanded = The readings here are solid, but they might be better if we could do them in a canyon.
		MunSrfLanded = You set the seismometer down and it promptly tumbles down the embankment to the bottom of the crater.  At least it registered something now!
		MunSrfLanded = There's an odd signature coming from the crater to the west. You report it to Mission Control, hoping they'll be proud of you.
		MunSrfLanded = It just detected an impact somewhere on the Mun.
		MunSrfLanded = Nothing to worry about. Really!
		MunSrfLanded = The readings indicate a massive rockfall nearby.
		MunSrfLanded = The periodic moon-quakes seem clear and easy to read here. The science team will want to see these numbers.

	@RESULTS
	{
		MunInSpaceHigh = The Twin 's gravitational signature is quite unique. Not surprising considering its unique features.
		MunInSpaceHigh = The gravity scanner has finished printing a black-and-white model of the Mun's gravity field. It looks rather dull so you take out your crayons and start colouring. 
		MunInSpaceHigh = Polar measurement of the Mun's gravitational field? Check! Time for a snack.
		MunInSpaceHigh = The gravitational anomaly emanated by the huge crater below has actually managed to ever so slightly adjust your orbit.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Bit by bit, the scientists back at KSC are using your data to build an accurate gravitational model of the Mun. 
		MunInSpaceHigh = A scientist back at KSC is guiding you through this gravity scan. He seems awfully excited about something called 'mascons'.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Watching the graviolis work is incredibly satisfying even if you aren't too keen on the math involved.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Your gravity map is showing the Midland Crates as small anomalies from the general background. Could there be a link between the formation of craters and the Mun's gravitational field?
		MunInSpaceHigh = You transmit the data back to KSC. Perhaps they can send you back something useful after they've processed the information.
		MunInSpaceHigh = The Mun's low gravity seems ideal for orbital infrastructure. You hope you live long enough to help make that happen.
		MunInSpaceHigh = You wonder what sorts of questions this data will answer back at KSC. Other than "What is the gravity like above the Mun"
		MunInSpaceHigh = There might be a slight gravitational anomaly here. Or you might just be seeing things and be in dire need of a snack.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Reading: nominal.  It's a crater on the mun, what did you expect?
		MunInSpaceHigh = The gravity signature is quite deep here. You suppose that makes sense.
		MunInSpaceHigh = Mun's gravitational signature is quite unique. Not surprising considering its unique features.
		MunInSpaceLow = The gravity scanner spits out an impressively long sheet of paper. To your dismay, it's almost entirely filled with numbers.
		MunInSpaceLow = Your gravity scan yields delicious science while you munch on a delicious snack.
		MunInSpaceLow = The scientists explained that accurate gravitational modelling is critical for ensuring navigation accuracy for future missions. Fine by you, especially if it means getting to go back again.
		MunInSpaceLow = The scanner is reading a large positive gravitational anomaly while over the Northern Basin.
		MunInSpaceLow = You're not too sure which of the scary-looking numbers (and letters!) on the screen are relevant to your situation. So you just write them all down and send them off to the guys back at KSC.
		MunInSpaceLow = You are slowly getting an accurate map of gravitational variances across the munar surface. It's not nearly as uniform as you thought it would be.
		MunInSpaceLow = You diligently record the gravitational data low over the Mun. Anything that makes landing there easier is fine by you.
		MunInSpaceLow = Wow these gravioli particles sure get excited when you activate the scanner.
		MunInSpaceLow = The graviolis report nominal readings for a crater this size. Maybe the next one will change things up.
		MunInSpaceLow = The gravity fluctuates slightly - but noticeably - as you pass over the crater below.
		MunInSpaceLow = You try to convince the graviolis that this is indeed an entirely new crater and not at all the same as the last one.
		MunInSpaceLow = Perhaps one day this data will be used to model tidal patterns back on Kerbin. Or something like that.
		MunInSpaceLow = The gravity readings fluctuate as you move from canyon to flat ground and back to canyon again.
		MunSrfLanded = The gravity scans here are normal.  Nothing to see here folks, move along.		
		MunSrfLanded = The gravity scan is far less interesting than snacks.  You emphatically relay this back to Mission Control.		
		MunSrfLanded = The graviolis here seem to be 'tilted', whatever that means.		
		MunSrfLanded = The gravioli curve here is smooth with no anomalies.  For once.
		MunSrfLanded = The graviolis seem to be resting at the bottom of the craters.  You make a note of this.
		MunSrfLanded = Gravity schmavity. Let's eat some snacks!
		MunSrfLanded = The graviolis are having fun bouncing off the crater walls.
		MunSrfLanded = The data returned by the instrument reveals an ever-so-slight anomaly caused by the Mun.
