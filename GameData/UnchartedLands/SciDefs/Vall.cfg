		VallInSpaceHigh = As you take your notes, you notice that Vall can fit in the hole of your clipboard.
		VallInSpaceHigh = You can swear you saw a black formation near the south pole, but you lost it before you could grab the binoculars.
		VallInSpaceHigh = The moon is a beautiful mosaic of gold and white.
		VallInSpaceLow = Staring out the window, you realize how white the moon really is.
		VallInSpaceLow = The surface looks broken by eons of freeze-thaw cycles.
		VallInSpaceLow = As you stare, something stirs inside you. You make a note to cook your food more carefully next time.
		VallSrfLanded = You note that Vall is "Cold, desolate... lonely." Mission Control tells you to quit being so melodramatic.
		VallSrfLanded = Everything in the ship just bounced, that was one heck of a quake!
		VallSrfLanded = You can't wait to go outside. It looks so beautiful!
		VallSrfLanded = Quakes rattle tools and loose gear every few minutes.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[evaReport]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		VallInSpaceHigh = You see a sparkling stream of crystals blast into the sky in the distance.
		VallInSpaceLow = You look at all the mountains and wonder what made them that way.
		VallSrfLanded = The rocks are of a goldish-orange color... Pretty!
		VallSrfLanded = The surface shivers as the deeper crust buckles and fractures. You want badly to get back inside the ship now.
		VallSrfLanded = Well, the ice is... thick. You wonder if there's a frozen waterfall somewhere.
		VallSrfLanded = The ground beneath you suddenly lurches, and you hear the sound, carried up through your feet, of immense ice plates scraping against each other.
		VallSrfLanded = The ground rumbles ominously beneath you before you realize that you're just hungry.
		VallSrfLanded = Ice crystals look very shiny.
		VallSrfLanded = You wish you'd brought your ice skates.
		VallSrfLanded = Ice melts down and evaporates from the friction of your space boots. You concentrate very hard on keeping your balance.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mysteryGoo]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		VallInSpaceHigh = The Goo turns gold and hard, but fluctuates internally.
		VallInSpaceLow = The Goo sparkles in the dim light.
		VallSrfLanded = The Goo oscillates once, then three times, then finally nine times.
	}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[surfaceSample]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		VallSrfLanded = After crushing some of the surface ice into a snow-cone and getting permission from mission control for an experiment, you find it doesn't taste particularly nice.
		VallSrfLanded = The icy crystals show signs of shock and sharp temperature change at some point in the past.
		VallSrfLanded = Strangely, some of the ice on the surface seems significantly fresher than the rest.
		VallSrfLanded = As you dig into the ice, a particularly nasty quake sends your shovel flying. Perhaps you shouldn't dig any deeper...
		VallSrfLanded = You analyse the frozen surface and find some golden flaky material.
		VallSrfLanded = You analyse the surface and find some beautiful orange and gold crystal structures.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mobileMaterialsLab]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		VallSrfLanded = You accidentally drop some ice from the lab onto the surface. You wonder if there is a way to tell the difference between Kerbin's ice and Vall's ice.
		VallSrfLanded = You hear a knocking coming from the inside of the materials bay, but good judgement keeps you from investigating further.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[temperatureScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		VallInSpaceLow = It's incredibly cold, but every now and then the temperature rises. Plumes of heat must be coming off the moon below.
		VallSrfLanded = There is a section below the surface that has a surprisingly high temperature for Vall. Being Vall, of course, it's still quite cold.
		VallSrfLanded = After scraping flecks of ice off the meter, you confirm that yes, it is indeed very cold out.
	}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[seismicScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		VallSrfLanded = This data would be very valuable in advancing science if the screen hadn't iced over.
		VallSrfLanded = Wow, what a quake! Something big must have just shifted underground.
		VallSrfLanded = The seismic scan indicates that there is a sudden density change a significant distance below the surface.
		VallSrfLanded = You detect some underground tremors. You ponder if they could be caused by cryovolcanic events.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		VallInSpaceHigh = You can feel some gravity already.
		VallSrfLanded = You notice the gravity scans have been saying 666 over and over again.
