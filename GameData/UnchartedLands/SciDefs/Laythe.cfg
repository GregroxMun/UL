	{
		LaytheInSpaceLow = The Goo seems right at home in space.
        LaytheInSpaceLow = The Goo seems comfortable.
        LaytheFlyingHigh = The Goo is pulsing gently. It is 15% more radioactive than when in Laythe's atmosphere.
		LaytheFlyingHigh = There does not seem to be much activity coming from the Containment Unit. Only close examination reveals a slight pulsing.
        LaytheFlyingLow = The Goo seems to be shivering. Perhaps the draft is making it cold?
		LaytheFlyingLow = You note that the mystery goo Containment Unit is wobbling a little. Is that the Goo? Or is it just the screws coming loose?
        LaytheSrfLanded = The Goo bubbles and burps a little.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[temperatureScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
        LaytheInSpaceLow = You forgot to cap your drink and it floated away. When you licked up the spill, your tongue froze to the radio panel. Mission Control asked if you were under attack by aliens.
		LaytheInSpaceLow = The temperature here looks much the same as anywhere else in space, a few degrees above absolute zero.
		LaytheFlyingHigh = The temperature fluctuates more than expected.
        LaytheFlyingLow = Kerbol is small but bright. The cockpit glass is very cold when you touch it.
		LaytheFlyingLow = Your temperature scan shows that it is too cold to pop a window open.
		LaytheFlyingLow = It's warmer near the surface. Laythe's oceans may indeed be water.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = Temperatures are similar to those of Kerbin's polar regions. The water hasn't frozen, though, most probably due to the high salinity.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = You wonder why the water isn't frozen.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The temperature is similar to being in a freezer.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The temperatures here are below water's freezing point. Clearly, the water here has odd characteristics.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[barometerScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		LaytheFlyingHigh = The air is thin and rarefied, but if you're getting readings this high up, there's a chance it gets dense enough for planes and parachutes closer to the surface.
		LaytheFlyingLow = The numbers are high... intriguingly high. Throw a bit more oxygen in this mix and you could live here.
		LaytheFlyingLow = It's thin, but it's there.
		LaytheFlyingLow = If this atmosphere had oxygen, you could take off your helmet and crack a window.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The atmosphere here is unusually dense.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[seismicScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{

		LaytheSrfLanded = You've set the craft right on top of a fault line! You find this both fascinating and absolutely terrifying.
		LaytheSrfLanded = Laythe shows some very important seismic activity. You're not sure the craft can survive a tsunami, but at least it keeps the moon temperate.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The readings fluctuate dramatically in conjunction with the waves. Perhaps it would be better to run this experiment on land, if there even is any.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
        LaytheInSpaceLow = You drop your pencil and it floats gently way.
		LaytheInSpaceLow = Your scanner shows that the gravitational draw of this moon does not change wherever you go. The water makes the planet smoother than a baby Kerbal's bottom.
		LaytheSrfLanded = You detect massive fluctuations as Tylo tugs on the moon's surface.
		LaytheSrfLanded = There does appear to be some gravity here.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The instrument shorts out before you can get an accurate reading.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[atmosphereAnalysis]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		LaytheFlyingHigh = The atmosphere reminds you of Kerbin; although, you wonder where all the nitrogen came from.
		LaytheFlyingHigh = The preliminary readings show an atmosphere nearly identical to Kerbin.
		LaytheFlyingHigh = The instruments detect hydrogen escaping into space. It would seem that the source of oxygen on Laythe is photo-dissociation of its water, and not photosynthesis.
		LaytheFlyingHigh = The air has breathable elements, but they're very cold and very thin.
		LaytheFlyingLow = There's Oxygen, Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and lots of water. You scribble down a note: "Invest in colonization program."
		LaytheFlyingLow = Black smoke, currants, cappuccino, and a hint of buttery beef.
		LaytheFlyingLow = The atmosphere appears to be made up of oxygen and nitrogen.
		LaytheFlyingLow = According to these readings, the air here is, in fact, breathable. You feel satisfied knowing that you won your bet with the science department.

		LaytheSrfLanded = There's definitely oxygen in the atmosphere.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The air is thinner here than on the mountain peaks!
		LaytheSrfLanded = The cold temperatures and thin atmosphere appear to have balanced each other out. A layer of high humidity hangs just over the water.
