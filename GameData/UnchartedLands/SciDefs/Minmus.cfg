		MinmusInSpaceHigh = Well, it's certainly much smaller in person.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = At this distance, Kerbin is little more than a pale blue dot, floating the the inky vastness of space.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = You wonder if it's possible to EVA to the surface and back.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = You wonder if landing on the top of a mountain will consume less fuel. It would be harder, though.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = Jet-packing down there would probably be fun. You doubt you could get back up, though.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = You wonder if Minmus tastes of mint, and if you could make a fortune selling tiny edible planets.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = You watch Minmus' surface shimmer beneath and wonder if your tongue would stick to the ground upon a thorough licking.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = Let's go back, I saw a cool rock down there.
		MinmusSrfLanded = Don't fall over, don't fall over, don't fall over...

	@RESULTS
	{
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = It looks so small, and yet so delicious.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = You are craving mint ice cream right about now.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = The surface seems to be a mixture of rock and ice... you wonder if it could be mined for fuel.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = You need to do something about the lack of snacks here.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = If the spaceship fails, you could probably use the jetpack to get back into orbit.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = The mesmerizing mountains almost make you forget to keep one hand on the ship's handle at all times.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You wonder how far you could slide down this hill...
		MinmusSrfLanded = You start to jury-rig a sled from spare parts, only to be interrupted by orders from Mission Control.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You could have sworn you saw a little boy and a tiger sledding down the hill in a toboggan. You check your O2 supply... Ah! Just hypoxia.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You spend several minutes contemplating how to taste the ground without removing your space suit's helmet before giving up.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You look at the peaks and wonder out loud whether you could jump over them. Mission Control advises you not to try.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The low gravity would make driving around difficult.
		MinmusSrfLanded = It is hard to control your movements in the low gravity.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The ground beneath you has the perfect consistency for snowballs. Sadly, you cannot find a worthy target.
		MinmusSrfLanded = As you exit your craft, you utter the words; "It's one small step for Kerbals, one giant leap for Kerbalkind."
		MinmusSrfLanded = You think you could drill some holes here and play golf... space golf, of course.
		MinmusSrfLanded = As far as you can tell in the low gravity, the ground is firm underfoot, and not as slippery as you had expected.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You have confirmed that the surface does not taste like mint ice cream.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The powdery substance on the surface gets kicked up with every step, you swat at it as it pelts your visor.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[surfaceSample]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		MinmusSrfLanded = It's snow, ice, some loose dirt, and a couple of pebbles, frozen together in a strangely complicated way.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The surface here looks even tastier than everywhere else.
		MinmusSrfLanded = It has the consistency of a snowball, and is likely to be just as good at being thrown into other Kerbals' faces.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The sample you've taken indicates that the surface is made from different types of snow and ice intricately intermixed with each other.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You take a handful of snow, ice, and dirt and put it into your sample bag. You hope the science team on Kerbin will figure out what it is and why it's not suitable for Kerbal consumption.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The sample contains several distinct types of ice frozen to form a complex, multi-layered pattern.
		MinmusSrfLanded = Ice up here has a very high reflectivity, which must significantly contribute to the high albedo of Minmus.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The sample consists of multiple layers of very reflective greenish ice. You wonder what compound gives it such a nice colour.
		MinmusSrfLanded = It's just ice, with occasional snowflakes here and there.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You want to get your helmet off and taste the sample. instead, you pull yourself together and continue with the mission.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The ground appears to be made of small, cyan crystals. It doesn't look like it would be enjoyable walking barefoot here.
		MinmusSrfLanded = As you gather up some Minmus material, you label it as "Definitely not ice".
		MinmusSrfLanded = You scoop a sample up to be analysed back home, then smear some over your gloves to sniff when you get back in the capsule. You bet it'll smell minty and delicious.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You taste the sample, and find that it does not taste like mint at all. You wonder where the medicine cabinet went.
		MinmusSrfLanded = Mission Control tentatively asks you how it tastes.
		MinmusSrfLanded = After excavating the surface, you find a hidden ice layer. The ice appears to have a slightly greenish tinge to it. Upon further examination, you find it to have the perfect consistency for snow-cones, yet the taste leaves much to be desired.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You try to taste the sample but your helmet gets in the way.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The white mountains have a snow-like surface. The frozen lakes seem to be made of the same substance, but much smoother.
		MinmusSrfLanded = Must... not... taste...
		MinmusSrfLanded = Glad of your geology classes, you search for rocks to analyze. Finding none, you curse bitterly.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You ask Mission Control if the substance could be marketed as some sort of air freshener. They consider your request. 
		MinmusSrfLanded = The surface seems to consist of tiny crystal-like grains.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mobileMaterialsLab]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = The samples react to the lack of an atmosphere.
		MinmusSrfLanded = Some of the surface dust reacts with the metal samples to produce an aquamarine rust. 
		MinmusSrfLanded = Some of the biological samples have not fared well. The metals, however, appear to be doing just fine.
		MinmusSrfLanded = As you open the doors a sample dashes past you towards the surface.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[temperatureScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		MinmusInSpaceLow = Minmus is cold, ice cream is cold. Coincidence? You hope not!
		MinmusSrfLanded = Temperature reads "Minty Fresh". You make an addendum requesting that all future thermometers use numbers instead of wisecracks.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The temperature is just cold enough for a good ice cream cone.
		MinmusSrfLanded = As you suspected, it's very cold here.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The ground seems to reflect most of the Sun's thermal energy, yet the ground temperature is much higher than it should be. This warrants further investigation.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The thermometer suddenly reads NaN. One of the wires must have come loose again.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You look up at Kerbin and it looks smaller than ever. You think you can just about make out the Mun, too.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[seismicScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		MinmusSrfLanded = A boulder rolling down the neighboring slope interferes with your readings.
		MinmusSrfLanded = There's a lot of static on the sensor feed. Are we sliding down the hill?
		MinmusSrfLanded = The vibrations indicate there's some rock under all that ice.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The lake beds rumble periodically. Perhaps the tidal forces are causing heating under all that ice.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The seismometer detects some minor quakes, and what sounds like bubbling. Perhaps these areas are resurfaced by occasional geological activity.
		MinmusSrfLanded = A large impact nearby sends shockwaves throughout the planet. This is a perfect opportunity to map the interior!
		MinmusSrfLanded = You watch the data as it clearly shows that nothing interesting is happening at all.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You detect somewhat violent shuddering somewhere on the opposite side of Minmus. It was likely caused by a small meteorite impact.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You detect some seismic activity, most likely caused by tidal forces.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = The needle doesn't seem to be moving. You're unsure whether this means that the instrument isn't working, or that the gravity is very, very weak.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The readings confirm what you've suspected for some time - Minmus is a small moon with weak gravity.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The sensor is picking up a lateral gravity gradient... Oh wait, it's just the tilt of the slope. Why did we land here again?
		MinmusSrfLanded = The gravity scan answers a question you came up with while eating breakfast this morning - yes, Minmus really is lighter than the Mun.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The readings are conclusive: What goes up will take a fairly long time to come down.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The sensor readings indicate that this would be a terrible location for a bouncy castle.
		MinmusSrfLanded = Despite assurances from mission planners that the readings here would be off the charts, the sensor refuses to register anything higher than "rather weak" gravity.
		MinmusSrfLanded = You notice the gravity scans have been saying 666 over and over again.
