	@RESULTS
	{
		DresInSpaceHigh = After noticing a large cut across Dres' surface, you wonder if any band-aids in the first aid kit are big enough.
		DresInSpaceHigh = Watching the planet turn beneath you, you already miss home.
		DresInSpaceLow = It's very brown and dusty down there. The VAB team is going to use this to lobby for better brown-resistant landing legs.
		DresInSpaceLow = This looks too small to be a planet.
		DresSrfLanded = It is exactly as brown and duty as expected. Not a bit of brown less, not a bit of dust more.
		DresSrfLanded = You bask in the knowledge that you have successfully landed on the Mun. Wait a second...
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[evaReport]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		DresInSpaceHigh = It's an airless rock floating through space!
		DresSrfLanded = For a moon of this size and gravity, there are an awful lot of craters.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mysteryGoo]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		DresInSpaceHigh = The Goo seems to look for a way to escape.
		DresSrfLanded = The Goo trembles. Is that fear?
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[surfaceSample]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		DresSrfLanded = The brown metallic sand looks nice and shiny, so you make a sandcastle.
		DresSrfLanded = The soil is very dark here. You are sure the scientists back on Kerbin will be able to find something interesting about the composition of Dres if you can get it back to them.
		DresSrfLanded = This grainy dust is not suggesting anything.
		DresSrfLanded = You take some sand. The color will go great on your sandcastle at home.
		DresSrfLanded = You find traces of a large crater of iron, likely deposited here by impacts over time.
		DresSrfLanded = The soil is very dark here. You are sure the scientists back on Kerbin will be able to find something interesting about the composition of Dres.
		DresSrfLanded = Well, THIS is a letdown.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mobileMaterialsLab]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		DresInSpaceHigh = The objects are still floating around and making a mess, though some of them have grouped together and occasionally you see a spark between them.
		DresInSpaceLow = Something must have hit the lab and mixed up all the samples. Probably a micro-meteor or something. You had nothing to do with it.
		DresSrfLanded = The samples are quiet. Too quiet.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[temperatureScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		DresSrfLanded = You think about going home soon, before Dres decides to visit the bad parts of space again.
		DresSrfLanded = You wonder if Tanya would like it here. It's much better than the Mun.
		DresSrfLanded = The temperature readings are as dull and unremarkable as Dres itself.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[seismicScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		DresSrfLanded = There is a faint pulsating vibration, like a heartbeat. But it's not a heartbeat, because that would be crazy.
		DresSrfLanded = You tap the ground a few times. Yep, it's on. This planet is just dead.
		DresSrfLanded = Seismic sensors show that this moon has little geologic activity. You wonder if detonating a fuel tank would somehow remedy the situation.
		DresSrfLanded = There's no internal movement. Aside from the impacts of meteors, the needle almost never moves.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		DresSrfLanded = The sensor is on the fritz again.
		DresSrfLanded = The gravity is a lot higher than Mun, but still not as much as Kerbin.
	}
}
