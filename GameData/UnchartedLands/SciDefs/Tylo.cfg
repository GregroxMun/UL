	@RESULTS
	{
		TyloInSpaceHigh = Was this orbit intentional, or is Mission Control hiding something from you?
		TyloInSpaceHigh = It's like Laythe, but without all the cool stuff like an atmosphere, oceans, or anything interesting. Okay, so it's not like Laythe at all.
		TyloInSpaceLow = You wonder why, despite its size, Tylo doesn't have an atmosphere.
		TyloInSpaceLow = The crew wonders why they even need to land on this miserable rock.
		TyloSrfLanded = You congratulate yourself on getting down here without excessive lithobraking. You then begin calculating your delta-V to see if you can get home.
		TyloSrfLanded = I was expecting a bounce in my step. Maybe my springs aren't working.
		TyloSrfLanded = You can't walk a few meters without your face becoming friends with the surface. It is a little agitating.
		TyloSrfLanded = The gravity is quite heavy and reminds you of home.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[evaReport]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		TyloInSpaceLow = You swear you just found Tylo's missing atmosphere! It's just too bad it floated away before you could grab it.
		TyloSrfLanded = Terrain looks like a mix of rocks, ice and dirt. You wonder at the lack of atmosphere.
		TyloSrfLanded = You look around, trying to decide if the nerve-racking descent was worth it. How are you going to get back?
		TyloSrfLanded = You try jumping... It isn't very effective
		TyloSrfLanded = Is it me, or did my spacesuit just get really heavy?
		TyloSrfLanded = They say the gravity of Tylo adds five pounds.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mysteryGoo]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		TyloSrfLanded = The Goo has no confidence in your ability to return home.
		TyloSrfLanded = The Goo resembles a green pancake.
		TyloSrfLanded = The Goo has a warm, slightly bluish glow. According to the manual, this means it's either been exposed to some weird particles or it's just happy to be in one piece.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[surfaceSample]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		TyloSrfLanded = The surface seems to be composed of rocks and ice. You quickly run density-mass calculations in your head, wondering how this body has so much gravity.
		TyloSrfLanded = The rock sample is similar to what could be found on the Mun. There seems to be less evidence of volcanic activity, however.
		TyloSrfLanded = You quickly scoop up some white dust. You ran out of condiments three months ago.
		TyloSrfLanded = Some rock samples exhibit high heavy metal content.
		TyloSrfLanded = The surface seems to be composed of rocks, nickel, a little bit of cobalt and ice.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mobileMaterialsLab]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		TyloInSpaceHigh = The metal is metallic, the wood is wooden, the glass is glassy. If Tylo is going change any of this you will have to get closer.
		TyloSrfLanded = The Goo looks very similar to peanut butter. Then you realize this isn't a Goo canister and someone got peanut butter all over your materials!
		TyloSrfLanded = It seems as if the samples have put on some weight.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[temperatureScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		TyloInSpaceLow = Reflected light from Tylo doesn't appear to transfer much heat to the surrounding space.
		TyloSrfLanded = It reads cold until you realize that all of the liquid in the thermometer has just pooled at the bottom.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[seismicScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		TyloSrfLanded = Periodic quakes roll through the moon, indicating the presence of massive cave networks.
		TyloSrfLanded = This moon appears to be mostly inactive geologically. You detect little to no activity.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		TyloInSpace = The gravity here is negative for some reason.
		TyloSrfLanded = Confirmed: Getting home will not be easy.
	}
}
