	@Body:HAS[#identifier[UL/Sun]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Ultima Luth^N
			%description = Ultima Luth is a K4V star off towards the center of the galaxy. It is noticeable as a fairly dim star in the sky. Its planetary system is remarkably similar to the Kerbol system, with a large Joolean planet just at the Snow Line, four terrestrial planets in the inner system, and an outer icy body. Ultima Luth comes from ancient Kerbal and, roughly translated, means "Uncharted Lands." Since the plane of the system is not aligned with our line of sight, none of the planets transit Ultima Luth, and thus, very little is known about the planets in the system.

			%displayName = Hoom^N

	@Body:HAS[#identifier[UL/Jool]]
	{
		@Properties

		{
			%displayName = Oleeo^N
			%description = This small planet at the outer edges of the system is probably the unluckiest body around. Covered by many huge crater marks, this hideously disfigured planet is beleived to hold a massive ocean under its dense icy crust. It's a shame it's so far from the Sun that it receives almost no energy! Otherwise, astrobiologists hypothesize this world might hold the keys to early life.
