{
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[UL/Sun]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = The Sun was the first star discovered by Kerbals. This orange dwarf star of spectral type K4V is just powerful enough to put out precious energy to drive the photosynthesis of life on the planet Kerbin. Any brighter and it is sure that the Ultraviolet emissions would cook a planet's atmosphere, any dimmer and there might not be high-enough energy to drive photosynthesis. The Sun is truly the optimal star for planetary habitability!
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[UL/Moho]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = The first planet in orbit around our star is Moho. A hot ball of rock, with strange formations that have stumped astronomers for decades. The only repreive from the proximity of this world to the sun, is that its tidally locked surface makes hiding from the intense heat a lot easier.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[UL/Eve]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = This beautiful object is the second planet of our solar system. While it may look calm from a distance, Eve is probably the most hostile body in our neighborhood. It's believed that Eve's proximity to the Sun is responsible for its distinct lack of moons, and thus it is forced to spend eternity on its own drifting through space.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[UL/Kerbin]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = The home of the Kerbals, Kerbin is the only planet in the system confirmed to posses life. It is believed that its unique system of underwater channels and lakes is partially responsible for keeping the planet habitable.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[UL/Minmus]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Minmus figures in Kerbal mythology as a guardian, marching along the celestial arch--the rings--to keep our planet and its rings safe. It turns out that's not far from the truth--the gravity of this tiny shepard is responsible for keeping the rings stable. Scientists hypothesize that an analysis of the material making up Kerbin's rings will match the surface material from this tiny moon.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[UL/Mun]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = The most iconic satellite of Kerbin, Mun is a desolate moon born from the early formation of Kerbin itself. There's strong evidence due to Mun's cracked surface, that it was fairly recently tectonically active, though it appears that its internal heating died out aeons ago.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[UL/Dres]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Beleived to be made mostly from the iron core of the body which struck Kerbin to form the Mun, Dres is a desolate dark ball of rock and metal. It appears however, that Dres is partially responsible for saving its parent body from a few percent of the larger asteroids, trapping & redicrecting them using its own gravity well.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[UL/Laythe]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = This oceanic world seems to be completely deprived of any landmasses at all! Its density would suggest that the planet is not only mostly water by area, but also mostly water by volume. Scientists believe the rich green color of its oceans points to evidence of simple algae present in the ocean, supported by its possibly breathable atmosphere.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[UL/Tylo]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Laythe's dead twin, Tylo, is a barren planet. Its surface composition seems to be rich in metallic ores with a large amount of ice across its mountainous surfaces. Scientists initially thought that this ice could be the remnants of Laythe's formation, but given Tylo's density, the whole planet must be mostly ice. Thus, the metallic ores observed through spectroscopy are a mystery.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[UL/Jool]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Jool, the Gas Giant. It was certainly a surprise to the first astronomer to train a spectroscope onto Jool, when he discovered that the atmosphere of Jool contained Hydrogen and Helium in about the same amounts as the Sun! However, most astronomers are more interested in its picturesque and serene appearance, but don't be fooled. Jool's atmosphere seems to be filled with swirling storms and crushing pressure, making any trip into the atmosphere a one-way mission.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[UL/Duna]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = This distant world has long fascinated the public and scientists alike. How a body so small could hold onto an atmosphere is unknown, however computer models of Duna have made one thing very clear: Duna must have been greatly impacted by the massive tidal forces generated as it swings through its orbit around Jool.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[UL/Ike]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = The mottled, patched appearance of Ike as seen with a telescope is one of the most prominent features when viewing images of this small icy moon. Perhaps Ike's geology is still fairly active, or perhaps the patchwork is some strange result of crater impacts.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[UL/Bop]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Bop was the last moon of Jool to be discovered due to its small size, and was a relatively unassuming minor body for a long time, until The Great Joolean Comet of '94. After Jool's gravity had torn the comet apart, most of the pieces struck Jool, but one of the larger pieces struck Bop, producing a dazzling display of cryovolcanic plumes for several months! Scientists are keen on getting a closer look at this recent impact site.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[UL/Vall]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Ever since the first clear images of Vall revealed a golden-white world, it has been theorized that Vall holds a large amount of precious metals under its thick layers of ice. While some parties have already begun planning missions to investigate, opposing parties with actual PhD's argue that a body with such a low density couldn't hold as much as they claim. This debate continues to this day. 
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[UL/Eeloo]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = This small planet at the outer edges of the system is probably the unluckiest body around. Covered by many huge crater marks, this hideously disfigured planet is beleived to hold a massive ocean under its dense icy crust. It's a shame it's so far from the Sun that it receives almost no energy! Otherwise, astrobiologists hypothesize this world might hold the keys to early life.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[UL/Pol]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Eeloo's miniature companion, Pol, is a tiny moon and difficult to view in any reasonable detail through even the largest telescopes. Cryovolcanic plumes have been observed several times, leading astronomers to believe that this volatile body may be internally active--and if Pol is active, then perhaps there's a chance that Eeloo is as well.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[UL/Gilly]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Gilly appears to be a captured body. Due to its retrograde orbit, its origins don't appear to lie with the formation of the planets in our system, instead being an extra-solar object that became captured around the Sun due to a fortunate encounter with Eeloo or Jool. Astronomers are curious about what secrets this small lump of ice and rock could tell us about the worlds of other star systems!
