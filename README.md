About
-----
Uncharted Lands is a procecurally created planet overhaul for KSP, designed to change things up in the stock system for a whole new game.

Instructions
------------
Firstly, ensure any older version of UL and Kopernicus have been removed.

You will need to DELETE (important) the following folders when updating:
- GameData/Kopernicus
- Gamedata/UnchartedLands

You will need to download it's dependency - Kopenicus. This is required to run the mod.
Just download the latest release, & and hotfixes available.

Simply merge the downloaded .zip files into your KSP directory the same as with any other mod.
DO NOT EXTRACT THE .zip FILE STRAIGHT OUT - open it and merge the contents.
This should be all you are required to do for a basic install.

PLEASE REMEMBER TO BACKUP YOUR SAVEGAMES BEFORE INSTALLATION/UPDATING AS BUGS CAN & SOMETIMES DO OCCUR.

if you need to reset your ships landed on planets before/after updating, please use hyperedit as it makes resetting them simple and easy.
